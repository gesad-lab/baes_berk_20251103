| Metric | ghspec | baes | chatdev |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Total Tokens (count) | 1.000 | 0.000 | 0.531 |
| Input Tokens (count) | 1.000 | 0.000 | 0.460 |
| Output Tokens (count) | 1.000 | 0.000 | 0.955 |
| Execution Time (seconds) | 0.744 | 0.000 | 1.000 |
| Total Cost (USD) | 1.000 | 0.000 | 0.781 |
| API Calls (count) | 0.733 | 0.000 | 1.000 |
| Cached Tokens (count) | 1.000 | 0.000 | 0.067 |

*Normalization formula: `(value - min) / (max - min)` where min/max are computed per metric across all frameworks. This places all metrics on a common [0, 1] scale for visual comparison.*

## Analysis

### Analysis

This radar chart provides a holistic multi-dimensional comparison of 3 frameworks across 7 metrics using normalized values on a common scale. **Overall Leader**: baes performs best on 7/7 metrics (100.0%). 

**Aggregation Methodology**: Each metric is represented by its **mean value** computed from 100 runs per framework. Values are then normalized using **min-max scaling** to [0, 1] range, where 0 represents the minimum observed value across all frameworks for that metric, and 1 represents the maximum. This normalization enables fair visual comparison despite different scales and units (e.g., tokens vs. seconds vs. dollars). 

**Interpretation Guidance**: In the radar visualization, larger polygons indicate higher raw values. For cost/time metrics where lower is better, smaller polygons are preferable. For throughput metrics where higher is better, larger polygons are preferable. The radar chart highlights patterns and trade-offs but should be supplemented with distribution plots (box/violin) for detailed statistical analysis. 

**Metrics Included**: Total Tokens (count), Input Tokens (count), Output Tokens (count), Execution Time (seconds), Total Cost (USD), and 2 more.
