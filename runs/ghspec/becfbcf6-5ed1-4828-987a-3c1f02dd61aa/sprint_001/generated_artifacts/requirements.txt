# Student Management Web Application

## Overview
The Student Management Web Application provides a simple API for managing student records. It allows users to create and retrieve student information and automatically handles database schema creation upon startup. The application is built following a microservices-oriented architecture for modularity and maintainability.

2. **Retrieve All Students**
   - **Method**: GET
   - **Endpoint**: `/students`
   - **Response**: JSON array containing objects for each Student with their details.

3. **Automatic Database Schema Creation**
   - The application will automatically create the necessary database schema upon startup if it does not already exist.

4. **HTTP Status Codes**
   - The application will return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages for successful and unsuccessful operations.
