# Implementation Plan: Student Management Web Application

## 1. Overview 
This implementation plan outlines the architecture, technologies, and approach for developing a Student Management Web Application. The application will facilitate the creation and retrieval of Student entities through a RESTful API while adhering to the specified functional requirements and coding standards.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Application Structure
- **Frontend**: Not included in this scope (API only).
- **Backend**: RESTful API developed using Python and FastAPI.
- **Database**: SQLite for development and testing purposes.

### 2.2 Components
- **API Endpoints**:
  - **POST /students**: Create a new Student.
  - **GET /students/{id}**: Retrieve a Student's details.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite (for simplicity, suitable for local development)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy for database interactions
- **Testing Framework**: pytest for unit and integration testing
- **Environment Management**: Poetry for dependency management
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI provided automatically by FastAPI

## 4. Implementation Approach

### 4.1 Database Design
- **Student Entity**:
  - ID (auto-generated integer)
  - name (string, required)

#### 4.1.1 Database Schema
The schema will be automatically created on startup using SQLAlchemy's declarative base:
```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from database import Base

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

### 4.2 API Contract

#### 4.2.1 Create Student Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `/students`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "string" (required)
  }
  ```

- **Response** (201 Created):
  ```json
  {
    "id": "integer",
    "name": "string"
  }
  ```

- **Error Response** (400 Bad Request):
  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "code": "E001",
      "message": "Name is required."
    }
  }
  ```

#### 4.2.2 Retrieve Student Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `/students/{id}`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response** (200 OK):
  ```json
  {
    "id": "integer",
    "name": "string"
  }
  ```

- **Error Response** (404 Not Found):
  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "code": "E002",
      "message": "Student not found."
    }
  }
  ```

### 4.3 Error Handling & Validation
- Validate that the name field is present before attempting to create a student record.
- Return structured error responses in JSON format as outlined in the API contract.

### 4.4 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test each individual API endpoint and validation logic (using pytest).
  
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Verify that the entire request flow works correctly (creating, retrieving records).

### 4.5 Startup Procedures
- Implement a startup event in FastAPI to create the database schema:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import engine, Base

app = FastAPI()

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

## 5. Scalability, Security, and Maintainability Considerations
- **Scalability**: For initial development, SQLite is sufficient. Consider transitioning to a more scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for production.
- **Security**: Inputs will be validated to prevent SQL injection and other potential attacks. To secure sensitive data handling in the future, encrypt PII as required.
- **Maintainability**: Adhere to clean code principles and separation of concerns practices. Make use of environment variables for configuration (using `.env` files).

## 6. Documentation
- A Swagger UI will be auto-generated by FastAPI and available at `/docs` for API interaction.
- Include `README.md` with setup instructions, usage examples, and details on project structure.

## 7. Milestones
1. **Setup Environment**: Configure development environment using Poetry, install necessary dependencies.
2. **Define Data Models**: Implement SQLAlchemy models for the Student entity.
3. **Implement API Endpoints**: Develop the designated API endpoints to create and retrieve Student records.
4. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests ensuring coverage.
5. **Documentation**: Generate API documentation and finalize README.

## 8. Trade-offs and Decisions
- Chose FastAPI for its simplicity, automatic data validation, and interactive documentation.
- Selected SQLite for local development due to its lightweight nature, understanding the need to migrate to a more robust database in future iterations.
- Delayed user authentication features to focus on core student management functionalities initially.

## Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the Student Management Web Application, emphasizing clean design, secure architecture, and comprehensive testing of student data management functionalities. Following this plan will ensure the project aligns with user needs and specified requirements while adhering to best practices in software development.
