# Student Management Application
This README provides an overview of the Student Management application, its setup, functionalities, and testing strategies.

## Overview
The Student Management application allows users to manage student records efficiently. It provides functionality to create, retrieve, and store student data within an SQLite database. This application is built using FastAPI, ensuring high performance and easy extensibility.

## Functional Requirements
- **Web Server**: The application hosts a web server capable of handling HTTP requests.
- **Student Creation**: A POST endpoint `/students` to create a student with a required `name` field.
- **Retrieve Students**: A GET endpoint `/students` to retrieve a list of all students.
- **Retrieve Single Student**: A GET endpoint `/students/{id}` to retrieve a specific student by ID.
- **Database Initialization**: The SQLite database schema is automatically created upon application startup, defining the "Student" table with a "name" field.

## Setup & Installation
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.11+ and SQLite installed on your machine.
   - Create a virtual environment and activate it.
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the FastAPI server:
     ```bash
     uvicorn src.main:app --reload
     ```

3. **Access the API**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to view the autogenerated API documentation provided by FastAPI.

## Testing
### Testing Scenarios
1. **Success Scenarios**:
   - Test that a student is successfully created with a valid name.
   - Test that all students can be retrieved successfully.
   - Test that retrieving an existing student by ID returns the correct data.

2. **Failure Scenarios**:
   - Test that the application returns an error when trying to create a student without a name.

3. **Database Table Creation**:
   - Implement a test to confirm that the student table is created on startup if it does not exist.

### Running Tests
- To run the tests using `pytest`, execute:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/test_student.py
  ```

## Development Notes
- The application will be extended in future versions to include more features such as updating and deleting student records.
- Contributions to enhance the functionality and performance of the application are welcome.
