# Feature: Create Course Entity

---

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this feature is to introduce a new Course entity within the existing student management system. By adding the Course entity, we aim to enhance the ability to organize and manage educational offerings. The new Course entity will consist of two required fields: name and level. This addition will empower the application to better support curriculum design, registrations, and connections between students and their respective courses.

## User Scenarios & Testing
### User Scenarios
1. **Creating a New Course**: A user can create a new course by providing the required fields: a name and a level. Upon successful creation, the application should respond with the course details.
2. **Retrieving Course List**: A user can request a list of all stored courses and will receive their names and levels in the response.
3. **Error Handling for Course Creation**: If a user attempts to create a course without providing either the name or level, the application should return an appropriate error message.

### Testing
- Verify that a new course can be added successfully with both a name and level.
- Confirm that retrieving courses returns the correct data format (JSON) including the name and level fields.
- Test response messages for field validations, ensuring that attempts to create a course without required fields result in proper error messages.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Course Creation**:
   - Implement a new POST API endpoint `/courses` that accepts a JSON object containing `name` and `level`.
   - Both `name` and `level` must be non-empty strings.
   - Successful creation returns the course's ID, name, and level in JSON format.

2. **Retrieve Courses**:
   - Implement a new GET API endpoint `/courses` that returns a JSON list of all courses, including their IDs, names, and levels.

3. **Error Messages**:
   - If a course creation request is missing either the `name` or `level` field or if they are empty, the application should return a 400 Bad Request error with a relevant message.

4. **Database Migration**:
   - Update the database schema to create a new Course table including the fields `id`, `name`, and `level`.
   - Ensure that the migration process does not interfere with existing Student data.

## Success Criteria
- Upon successful deployment, a GET request to the endpoint `/courses` returns a list of courses in JSON format, including their IDs, names, and levels.
- A POST request to `/courses` results in a new course being created, successfully returning the course ID, name, and level in the response.
- An attempt to create a course without required fields returns a 400 error with clear messages.
- The Course entity is successfully added to the database schema without affecting existing Student data during migration.

## Key Entities
### Course Entity
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (auto-generated by the database).
  - `name`: Required string field representing the name of the course.
  - `level`: Required string field representing the level of the course (e.g., "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced").

## Assumptions
- The application will maintain consistent data integrity standards across entities.
- Standard naming conventions for fields (e.g., case sensitivity) will be followed.
- Appropriate validations for string length and content will be implemented.
- The application remains hosted in an environment that supports the existing tech stack used in the previous sprints.

## Out of Scope
- Modifications to existing entities beyond the Course entity; this specification focuses only on the Course functionality.
- User authentication and authorization features related to course management.
- Additional features like course enrollment or linking courses to students are not covered in this scope.

By implementing the above feature, the course management capabilities are significantly enhanced, providing necessary building blocks for a more comprehensive educational framework within the existing application.
