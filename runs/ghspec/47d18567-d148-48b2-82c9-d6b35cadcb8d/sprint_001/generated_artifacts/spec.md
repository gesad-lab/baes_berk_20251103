# Feature: Student Web Application

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this feature is to create a simple web application for managing student entities. Each student will have a required name field. The application will serve as an introductory platform for handling student data and efficiently managing CRUD operations through a web API. This feature aims to provide a functional, user-friendly interface for adding and retrieving student information.

## User Scenarios & Testing
### User Scenarios
1. **Adding a New Student**: A user can create a new student by providing a name. Upon successful creation, the application responds with the student details.
2. **Retrieving All Students**: A user can request a list of all stored students. The application will return this list in JSON format.
3. **Error Handling**: If a user attempts to add a student without providing a name, the application should respond with an appropriate error message.

### Testing
- Ensure that a new student can be added successfully.
- Verify that retrieving students returns the correct data format (JSON).
- Test response messages for required field validations.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Student Creation**:
   - A POST API endpoint `/students` should accept a JSON object with a `name` field.
   - The `name` field must be a non-empty string.
   - Successful creation returns the student’s ID and name in JSON format.
  
2. **Retrieve Students**:
   - A GET API endpoint `/students` should return a JSON list of all students, including their IDs and names.

3. **Error Messages**:
   - If a student creation request is missing the `name` field or it’s empty, the application should return a 400 Bad Request error with a relevant message.

4. **Database Initialization**:
   - On startup, the application should automatically create the SQLite database schema for the Student entity if it does not already exist.

## Success Criteria
- The application is deployed and accessible.
- The `/students` endpoint returns a list of students in JSON format when accessed with a GET request.
- A POST request to `/students` results in a new student being created, with a success response including the student ID.
- An attempt to create a student with an empty name returns a 400 error with a clear message.

## Key Entities
### Student Entity
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (auto-generated by the database).
  - `name`: Required string field representing the student's name.

## Assumptions
- The application will be hosted in an environment that supports Python 3.11+ and allows for the use of FastAPI.
- Required configurations, such as the SQLite database path, will be appropriately set in the environment.

## Out of Scope
- User authentication and authorization.
- Advanced functionalities such as updating or deleting students beyond the basic requirements.
- Frontend development – this specification focuses solely on the backend web application.
