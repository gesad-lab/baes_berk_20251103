# Student Management Application

This application allows for the management of student records through a RESTful API. Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete student information.

## API Endpoints

### Create a Student

**POST** `/students`

This endpoint creates a new student record.

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "name": "string",  // The name of the student
  "email": "string"  // The email address of the student (must be a valid email format)
}
```

#### Response
- **Success (201 Created)**:
```json
{
  "id": "string",     // The unique identifier for the student
  "name": "string",   // The name of the student
  "email": "string"   // The email address of the student
}
```

- **Error (400 Bad Request)**:
  If the request is missing the `email` field, or if the email is empty or invalid, a 400 error will be returned with a message indicating the issue:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "E001",
    "message": "Invalid email format.",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

### Retrieve Students

**GET** `/students`

This endpoint retrieves a list of all students.

#### Response
- **Success (200 OK)**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "string",     // The unique identifier for the student
    "name": "string",   // The name of the student
    "email": "string"   // The email address of the student
  },
  ...
]
```

## Overview & Purpose

The purpose of this feature is to enhance the existing Student entity by adding an email field that will allow for better communication and data management. By requiring an email address for each student, the application aims to improve the overall functionality and utility of student records. 

## Success Criteria

- The endpoint `/students` returns a list of students in JSON format, including IDs, names, and emails.
- A POST request to `/students` results in a new student being created with a response that includes the student ID, name, and email.
- An attempt to create a student without an email or with an invalid email address returns a 400 error with a clear message describing the issue.
- The email field is successfully added to the Student entity within the database, and existing data is intact following the migration.

## Development Workflow

1. Add `email` field to the `Student` model in `models.py`.
2. Update API endpoint logic in `student.py` to accept and manage the new email parameter.
3. Implement validation logic for the email field in `student_validators.py`.
4. Create and apply a new migration script using Alembic to modify the database schema.
5. Update unit tests in `test_student.py` to cover new functionality, particularly validating email input.
6. Document changes in `README.md` (this document). 

As a result, this documentation serves to outline the functionalities related to the new `email` field for easier management of student records.
