# Student Management Web Application

## Overview & Purpose
The Student Management Web Application aims to provide a simple interface for managing student records with a focus on their names. This web application will enable users to create, read, update, and delete student information using a straightforward API, ensuring data persistence through the use of a SQLite database. The purpose of this application is to demonstrate best practices in web application development while providing an easy-to-use service for managing student entities.

## Technical Plan
The project is organized into the following directories:

```
/student_management_app
│
├── src/                     # Source code for the application
│   ├── main.py              # Entry point for the FastAPI application
│   ├── models.py            # Database models (SQLAlchemy)
│   ├── schemas.py           # Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
│   ├── routes/              # API route handlers
│   │   └── student_routes.py # Endpoint definitions related to students
│   └── database.py          # Database connection and setup
│
├── tests/                   # Testing files
│   ├── test_student_routes.py # Tests for student API routes
│   └── test_database.py      # Tests for database interactions
│
├── .env.example              # Example environment variables
├── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
└── README.md                 # Documentation for setup and usage
```

## Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Database**: SQLite (embedded database for simplicity)
- **Data Access**: SQLAlchemy (for ORM interaction with SQLite)
- **API Documentation**: Automatically generated with FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI support
- **Testing Framework**: pytest for unit and integration testing
- **Environment Management**: `venv` for virtual environment management
- **Dependency Management**: `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies

## Success Criteria
1. API returns valid JSON responses according to the specifications for each endpoint.
2. The SQLite database is correctly initialized, and the schema is created on application startup.
3. All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) function as intended without errors.
4. The application complies with best practices for web application structure and organization.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student_management_app.git
   cd student_management_app
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values accordingly.

6. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.main:app --reload
   ```

7. **Access the API documentation:**
   - Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to view the interactive API documentation.
