## Task Breakdown

### 1. Create Course Model
- **Task**: Implement SQLAlchemy model for the Course entity.
- **File**: `src/models.py`
- **Details**: Add a new `Course` class with attributes `id`, `name`, and `level`.
- **Dependencies**: None
- [ ] Update `models.py` to define the new Course model.

### 2. Create Pydantic Schemas
- **Task**: Implement Pydantic schemas for Course validation.
- **File**: `src/schemas.py`
- **Details**: Define `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas with validation for the name and level fields.
- **Dependencies**: Task 1 (Course Model must exist)
- [ ] Update `schemas.py` to create CourseCreate and CourseResponse classes.

### 3. Implement Course Routes
- **Task**: Create API routes for managing courses.
- **File**: `src/routes/course_routes.py`
- **Details**: Create endpoints for `POST /courses` (create a course) and `GET /courses` (retrieve all courses).
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 1 and 2 (Course Model and Schemas must exist)
- [ ] Create `course_routes.py` and implement the endpoints.

### 4. Update Database Initialization
- **Task**: Modify the database setup to integrate the new Course model.
- **File**: `src/database.py`
- **Details**: Enhance the database initialization script to include the Course table.
- **Dependencies**: Task 1 (Course Model must exist)
- [ ] Update `database.py` to accommodate the Course table in the schema.

### 5. Create Database Migration Script
- **Task**: Create a migration to add the Course table.
- **File**: Migration file generated by Alembic
- **Details**: Use Alembic to create a migration that facilitates the addition of the Course table to the existing schema.
- **Dependencies**: Task 1 (Course Model must exist)
- [ ] Run Alembic command to generate migration script for Course table.

### 6. Implement Unit Tests
- **Task**: Create unit tests for course functionality.
- **File**: `tests/test_course_routes.py`
- **Details**: Implement tests to verify course creation and retrieval.
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 3 and 4 (API Routes and Model Integration must exist)
- [ ] Create `test_course_routes.py` to add test functions for course API.

### 7. Update Existing Tests
- **Task**: Ensure that existing tests for student routes remain unaltered.
- **File**: `tests/test_student_routes.py`
- **Details**: Confirm that the addition of the Course entity does not interfere with existing functionality.
- **Dependencies**: None
- [ ] Review `test_student_routes.py` to ensure there are no conflicts with new course functionality.

### 8. Update README Documentation
- **Task**: Document the new Course API endpoints in README.md.
- **File**: `README.md`
- **Details**: Provide clear instructions regarding the new Course functionality, usage examples, and updated API specifications.
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 3 and 6 (Course Routes and Tests must be completed)
- [ ] Revise `README.md` to include Course entity information.

These tasks will ensure that the Course entity is successfully integrated into the Student Management Web Application while maintaining consistency and adherence to coding standards. Each task is scoped to one file for clarity and independent execution.
