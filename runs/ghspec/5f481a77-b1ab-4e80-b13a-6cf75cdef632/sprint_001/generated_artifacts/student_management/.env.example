# Project Title: Student Management System

## Description
The Student Management System is a simple RESTful API built with Flask that allows users to manage student data. Users can create new student records, retrieve existing records, and handle input validation to ensure data integrity.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student_management.git
   cd student_management
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Install the required packages defined in `requirements.txt`.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file:**
   Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables as needed.

5. **Run the application:**
   Start the application with:
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```

## API Usage Examples

1. **Creating a Student**
   - **Endpoint:** `POST /students`
   - **Request body:**
     ```json
     {
       "name": "John Doe"
     }
     ```
   - **Response:**
     - Success:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Student created successfully.",
       "student": {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "John Doe"
       }
     }
     ```
     - Error (missing name):
     ```json
     {
       "error": {
         "code": "E001",
         "message": "Name is required."
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Retrieving a Student**
   - **Endpoint:** `GET /students/{id}`
   - **Response:**
     - Success:
     ```json
     {
       "id": 1,
       "name": "John Doe"
     }
     ```
     - Error (not found):
     ```json
     {
       "error": {
         "code": "E002",
         "message": "Student not found."
       }
     }
     ```

## Testing Instructions

To ensure the integrity of the application, tests are provided for endpoints and validation:

1. **Run tests with pytest:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

2. **Test scenarios include:**
   - Verify that the API returns a success message and the created student entity when valid input is provided.
   - Ensure the API returns the correct student details when queried with a valid identifier.
   - Validate that the API returns an appropriate error message when input validation fails (i.e., missing name).

Make sure to refer to the test files in the `tests/` directory for detailed test cases and expected outcomes.
