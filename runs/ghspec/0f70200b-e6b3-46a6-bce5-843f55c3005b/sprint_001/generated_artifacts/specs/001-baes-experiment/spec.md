# Feature: Student Management Application

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this feature is to create a simple web application that allows users to manage Student entities. Each Student will consist of a single required field, `name`, which is a string. The application will automatically handle the creation of the underlying SQLite database schema upon startup, providing a persistent data layer for storing Student entities. This web application aims to demonstrate how to manage and retrieve student data in a structured and efficient manner.

## User Scenarios & Testing
1. **Creating a Student**: 
   - As a user, I want to create a new student by providing a name so that I can store student data.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a POST request to the `/students` endpoint with valid data returns a success response and that the student is created in the database.

2. **Retrieving a Student**: 
   - As a user, I want to retrieve a student's details using their ID to view their information.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a GET request to the `/students/{id}` endpoint returns the correct student data.

3. **Creating Student without Name**: 
   - As a user, I want to receive an error when I try to create a student without a name to ensure the data integrity of the system.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a POST request to the `/students` endpoint without a `name` field returns a 400 Bad Request response with an appropriate error message.

4. **Retrieving all Students**:
   - As a user, I want to see a list of all students stored in the application.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a GET request to the `/students` endpoint returns all the students in the database in JSON format.

## Functional Requirements
1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /students`: Create a new student with a required `name` field.
   - `GET /students`: Retrieve a list of all students.
   - `GET /students/{id}`: Retrieve a specific student by their ID.

2. **Data Model**:
   - Student entity should have the following attribute:
     - `name` (string, required).
     
3. **Database Setup**:
   - Automatically initialize the SQLite database schema on application startup.
   - Persist Student entities in the SQLite database.

4. **Responses**:
   - All API responses should be in JSON format.
   - Error messages should indicate the reason for the failure clearly.

## Success Criteria
- The application should successfully create, retrieve, and list Student entities.
- The database schema must be created automatically without manual intervention upon startup.
- All errors must return appropriate HTTP status codes, and the responses must include a human-readable error message.
- The API should return valid JSON responses with correct content types.

## Key Entities
- **Student**: 
  - `id` (integer, auto-incremented primary key, autogenerated by SQLite).
  - `name` (string, required).

## Assumptions
- The application will be run in an environment where Python 3.11+ is already installed.
- Users accessing the API will send requests with appropriate headers for content type (application/json).
- The SQLite database can be used as the persistent storage layer.

## Out of Scope
- User authentication or authorization mechanisms.
- Advanced error handling and validation beyond the basic requirements.
- Pagination or filtering for listing students.
- Frontend UI components; the focus is strictly on the backend API functionality.
