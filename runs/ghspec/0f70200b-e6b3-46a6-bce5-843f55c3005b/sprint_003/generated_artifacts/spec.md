# Feature: Create Course Entity

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this feature is to introduce a new Course entity in the Student Management Application to facilitate better organization of student studies. The Course entity will contain `name` and `level` fields, both of which are required. This enhancement aims to provide the ability to categorize and manage courses effectively within the system, enabling improved tracking and reporting of student enrollment in various courses.

## User Scenarios & Testing
1. **Creating a Course**: 
   - As an admin user, I want to create a new course by providing both a name and a level so that I can store course information.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a POST request to the `/courses` endpoint with valid data (name and level) returns a success response and that the course is created in the database.

2. **Creating a Course without Name**: 
   - As an admin user, I want to receive an error when I try to create a course without a name to ensure the accuracy and completeness of course data.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a POST request to the `/courses` endpoint without a name returns a 400 Bad Request response with an appropriate error message.

3. **Creating a Course without Level**: 
   - As an admin user, I want to receive an error when I try to create a course without a level to ensure the accuracy of course data.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a POST request to the `/courses` endpoint without a level returns a 400 Bad Request response with an appropriate error message.

4. **Retrieving a Course**: 
   - As an admin user, I want to retrieve the details of a course using its ID to view its information.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a GET request to the `/courses/{id}` endpoint returns the correct course data including the name and level fields.

5. **Retrieving all Courses**: 
   - As an admin user, I want to see a list of all existing courses stored in the application.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a GET request to the `/courses` endpoint returns all the courses in the database in JSON format.

## Functional Requirements
1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /courses`: Create a new course with required `name` and `level` fields.
   - `GET /courses`: Retrieve a list of all courses, returning their names and levels.
   - `GET /courses/{id}`: Retrieve a specific course by its ID.

2. **Data Model**:
   - Course entity should have the following attributes:
     - `name` (string, required).
     - `level` (string, required).

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Update the database schema to include a new `Course` table with the fields specified.
   - Perform a database migration to ensure existing Student data is preserved and properly transitioned.

4. **Responses**:
   - All API responses should be in JSON format with the name and level fields included.
   - Error messages should clearly indicate reasons for creation failure regarding missing fields.

## Success Criteria
- The application should successfully create, retrieve, and list Course entities with the required fields.
- The database schema should reflect the newly added Course table without affecting existing Student data.
- All errors must return appropriate HTTP status codes, and responses must include clear error messages when required fields are missing.
- The API should return valid JSON responses with correct content types.

## Key Entities
- **Course**:
  - `id` (integer, auto-incremented primary key, autogenerated by SQLite).
  - `name` (string, required).
  - `level` (string, required).

## Assumptions
- The application continues to operate in an environment where Python 3.11+ is installed.
- Users accessing the API will correctly use headers appropriate for content type (application/json).
- The existing SQLite database can manage the schema changes required for the migration without data loss.

## Out of Scope
- User authentication or authorization mechanisms for managing courses.
- Advanced error handling and validation beyond the required fields for the Course entity.
- Frontend UI components associated with the Course entity; the focus is strictly on backend API functionality.
- Additional features or fields outside the specified scope of creating the Course entity.
