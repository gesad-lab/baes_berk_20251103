# Feature: Add Email Field to Student Entity

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this feature is to extend the existing Student entity in the Student Management Application by adding an `email` field. The `email` field will be a required string that allows for better identification and communication with students. This enhancement aims to improve the data integrity and functionality of the application while preserving existing student information during the update.

## User Scenarios & Testing
1. **Creating a Student with Email**: 
   - As a user, I want to create a new student by providing both a name and an email so that I can store complete student data.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a POST request to the `/students` endpoint with valid data (name and email) returns a success response and that the student is created in the database.

2. **Creating a Student without Email**: 
   - As a user, I want to receive an error when I try to create a student without an email to ensure the data integrity of the system.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a POST request to the `/students` endpoint without an email returns a 400 Bad Request response with an appropriate error message.

3. **Retrieving a Student with Email**: 
   - As a user, I want to retrieve a student's details (including their email) using their ID to view their complete information.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a GET request to the `/students/{id}` endpoint returns the correct student data, including the email field.

4. **Retrieving all Students with Email**:
   - As a user, I want to see a list of all students stored in the application along with their email addresses.
   - **Testing**: Verify that a GET request to the `/students` endpoint returns all the students in the database in JSON format, including the email field.

## Functional Requirements
1. **API Endpoints** (No modifications to existing functionality):
   - `POST /students`: Create a new student with required `name` and `email` fields.
   - `GET /students`: Retrieve a list of all students, including their email addresses.
   - `GET /students/{id}`: Retrieve a specific student by their ID, including their email.

2. **Data Model**:
   - Student entity should now have the following attributes:
     - `name` (string, required).
     - `email` (string, required).

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Update the database schema to include the new `email` field for the Student entity.
   - Perform a database migration to preserve existing Student data.

4. **Responses**:
   - All API responses should continue to be in JSON format with the email field included.
   - Error messages should clearly indicate reasons for creation failure regarding the email field.

## Success Criteria
- The application should successfully create, retrieve, and list Student entities with the new `email` field.
- Existing student data must remain intact and accessible after the migration.
- All errors must return appropriate HTTP status codes, and responses must include a human-readable error message when email is missing or invalid.
- The API should return valid JSON responses with correct content types and the necessary information.

## Key Entities
- **Student**: 
  - `id` (integer, auto-incremented primary key, autogenerated by SQLite).
  - `name` (string, required).
  - `email` (string, required).

## Assumptions
- The application continues to be run in an environment where Python 3.11+ is installed.
- Users accessing the API will send requests with appropriate headers for content type (application/json).
- The SQLite database can accommodate schema changes and migrations without data loss.
  
## Out of Scope
- User authentication or authorization mechanisms.
- Advanced error handling and validation beyond the basic requirements for the email field.
- Frontend UI components; the focus is strictly on the backend API functionality.
- Any additional fields or features outside the specified scope of enhancing the Student entity with an email field.
