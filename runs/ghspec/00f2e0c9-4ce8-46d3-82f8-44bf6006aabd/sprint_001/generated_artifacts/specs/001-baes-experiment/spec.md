# Feature: Student Entity Web Application

## Overview & Purpose
The Student Entity Web Application enables users to create, read, update, and delete student entries, which consist solely of a name field. The main purpose of this feature is to serve as a straightforward educational tool for managing student records in a simplistic manner, promoting best practices in web application structure and database interaction.

## User Scenarios & Testing
1. **Creating a Student**:
   - User sends a POST request with a JSON body containing the student's name.
   - The application responds with a success message and the created student's data.

2. **Fetching a Student**:
   - User sends a GET request to retrieve the details of a specific student by ID.
   - The application responds with the student's name in a JSON format.

3. **Updating a Student**:
   - User sends a PUT request with a JSON body to update the student's name.
   - The application responds with a success message and the updated student data.

4. **Deleting a Student**:
   - User sends a DELETE request with the student ID to remove the student from the database.
   - The application responds with a confirmation message.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - User receives appropriate error messages for invalid requests, such as missing name, student not found, or invalid ID.

## Functional Requirements
1. **API Endpoints**:
   - POST `/students`: Create a new student (requires name).
   - GET `/students/{id}`: Retrieve a student by ID.
   - PUT `/students/{id}`: Update a student's name by ID (requires name).
   - DELETE `/students/{id}`: Delete a student by ID.

2. **Database Interaction**:
   - Automatically create the database schema for the Student entity on application startup.
   - Store the student's name as a required string field in the SQLite database.

3. **Response Format**:
   - All API responses should be in JSON format.

4. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensure the name field is required and validate its format.

## Success Criteria
- The application successfully allows users to create, read, update, and delete student records.
- All API responses are returned in valid JSON format.
- The database schema is created upon application startup.
- Appropriate error messages are returned for invalid operations (e.g., missing name).

## Key Entities
- **Student**:
  - `id`: Integer (auto-incremented primary key, generated by the database)
  - `name`: String (required)

## Assumptions
- The users of the web application are familiar with making API requests using tools such as Postman or cURL.
- The application will be accessible via a local server for testing purposes.

## Out of Scope
- User authentication and authorization are not included in this feature.
- The application does not support advanced features such as file uploads or complex query functionalities beyond basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Front-end user interfaces are not covered; this specification focuses solely on the back-end API behavior.
