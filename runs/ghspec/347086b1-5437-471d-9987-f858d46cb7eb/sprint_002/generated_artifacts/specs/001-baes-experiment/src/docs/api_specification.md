# API Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the API specifications for our application, built with Python 3.11+ using FastAPI as the web framework. The following key sections detail the endpoints and their functionalities.

## Changes in API Specification

### 1. New Email Field for Student Creation

- **Endpoint**: `POST /students`
- **Description**: This endpoint allows for the creation of a new student.
- **New Parameter**: 
  - `email` (optional, string): This new field accepts an email address for the student. 

- **Default Behavior**: When an email is not provided, the system maintains sensible defaults, allowing existing operations (which do not utilize the new email field) to function without necessitating changes to current implementation.

- **Example Request**:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

- **Example Response**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### 2. Testing Updates

Testing for the new email field will be added to ensure that both scenarios (with and without email) are appropriately handled by the application, maintaining the integrity of existing functionalities.

## Technology Stack
