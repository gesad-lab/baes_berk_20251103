# Course Entity Management

This project provides an API for managing courses within an educational context. It utilizes FastAPI to build a RESTful API for CRUD operations on course entities, leveraging SQLite for the database and SQLAlchemy for ORM capabilities.

## II. Technology Stack
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI (for building the API)
- **Database**: SQLite (lightweight and serverless)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (for object-relational mapping)
- **Testing Framework**: pytest (for unit and integration testing)
- **Environment Management**: Poetry (for dependency management)
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI (auto-generated documentation through FastAPI)

## III. Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/course_entity_management.git
   cd course_entity_management
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Poetry installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables**:
   Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and populate with the required values for your environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

## IV. Running the Application
To start the application, run:
```bash
poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see the interactive API documentation generated by OpenAPI.

## V. Database Migration
To create and manage database migrations, Alembic is required. You can create a new migration to add the `courses` table with:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add courses table"
```
And upgrade the database with:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## VI. Running Tests
To run the test suite, execute:
```bash
poetry run pytest
```
Tests for both API and services are located in the `tests` directory.
