## API Endpoints

### Create Student Endpoint
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Endpoint**: `/students`
- **Request Body**:
  - JSON object containing:
    - `name` (string, required)
- **Response**:
  - `201 Created` on successful creation
  - `400 Bad Request` for validation errors

**Example Request**:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

### Retrieve Students Endpoint
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Endpoint**: `/students`
- **Response**:
  - `200 OK` with a JSON array of student objects containing names.

**Example Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Smith"
  }
]
```

## Error Handling
- When attempting to create a student without a name, the application will return a `400 Bad Request` error.
  
**Example Error Response**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "E001",
    "message": "Name is required."
  }
}
```

## Testing
- Test cases are located in the `tests/` directory, covering both unit tests for the service layer and integration tests for API endpoints.
- Ensure all tests run successfully before deploying changes.
