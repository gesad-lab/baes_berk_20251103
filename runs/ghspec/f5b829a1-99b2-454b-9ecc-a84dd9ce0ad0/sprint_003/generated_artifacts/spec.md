# Feature: Create Course Entity

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this feature is to introduce a new Course entity within the existing application framework. This Course entity will have two required fields: name and level. Implementing the Course entity will enhance the application's data model by allowing for better organization and categorization of courses, ultimately supporting future growth in student course management and curriculum offerings. This addition is aligned with enhancing the overall user experience and fulfilling the needs of educators and administrators in managing educational offerings.

## User Scenarios & Testing
1. **Create a Course**:
   - A user submits a request to create a new course with a specified name and level.
   - The system returns a success response with the created course's details.

2. **Retrieve a Course**:
   - A user requests to retrieve a course by its ID.
   - The system returns the course's details including the name and level.

3. **Handle Invalid Course Input**:
   - A user submits a request to create a course without providing a name.
   - The system returns an appropriate error response indicating the required name field is missing.
   - A user submits a request to create a course without providing a level.
   - The system returns an appropriate error response indicating the required level field is missing.

### Testing Scenarios
- Test creating a Course with valid name and level input.
- Test creating a Course with a missing name field.
- Test creating a Course with a missing level field.
- Test retrieving an existing Course by ID.
- Test retrieving a non-existent Course by ID.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Create Course**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /courses`
   - Request body: `{ "name": "string", "level": "string" }` (Both fields are required)
   - Response: 201 Created with JSON body `{ "id": "integer", "name": "string", "level": "string" }`.

2. **Retrieve Course**:
   - Endpoint: `GET /courses/{id}`
   - Response: 200 OK with JSON body `{ "id": "integer", "name": "string", "level": "string" }`.
   - Response for non-existing course: 404 Not Found with an error message.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the name field is missing in the creation request, return 400 Bad Request with a message detailing the error.
   - If the level field is missing in the creation request, return 400 Bad Request with a message detailing the error.

4. **Persistence**:
   - Create a new Course table in the database schema with name and level fields.
   - Ensure that the database migration is implemented in a way that preserves existing Student data.

## Success Criteria (measurable, technology-agnostic)
- The application successfully includes a new Course entity that can be created and retrieved without errors.
- A Course can be created with valid name and level, and can be retrieved using a unique ID, which includes both fields in the response.
- The application properly handles missing input by returning appropriate error messages when either the name or level is not provided.
- All API responses conform to the specified JSON format.
- The existing Student data remains intact and available after implementing the migration.

## Key Entities
- **Course**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (auto-generated by the database).
  - `name`: String (required).
  - `level`: String (required).

## Assumptions
- A user will submit requests using an appropriate RESTful client or interface.
- The application will run in the same environment as previous sprints.
- Users are familiar with submitting API requests and handling responses.
- The database system supports migrations seamlessly.

## Out of Scope
- Any functionality involving updating or deleting Course records.
- User authentication or authorization mechanisms.
- Frontend interface for the web application (only API endpoints are considered).
- Any additional fields or entities beyond the Course name and level fields.
- Integrating Courses with Students until future sprints.
