# Feature: Student Management Web Application

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this feature is to create a web application that provides a RESTful interface for managing Student entities. Each Student entity will have a required name field. This application aims to facilitate the creation and retrieval of student records, providing a foundation for future enhancements such as updates and deletions.

## User Scenarios & Testing
1. **Create a Student**:
   - A user submits a request to create a new student with a specified name.
   - The system returns a success response with the created student's details.

2. **Retrieve a Student**:
   - A user requests to retrieve a student by their ID.
   - The system returns the student's details including the name.

3. **Handle Invalid Input**:
   - A user submits a request to create a student without a name.
   - The system returns an appropriate error response indicating the required field is missing.

### Testing Scenarios
- Test creating a Student with valid input.
- Test creating a Student with missing name field.
- Test retrieving an existing Student by ID.
- Test retrieving a non-existent Student by ID.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Create Student**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /students`
   - Request body: `{ "name": "string" }` (Required)
   - Response: 201 Created with JSON body `{ "id": "integer", "name": "string" }`.

2. **Retrieve Student**:
   - Endpoint: `GET /students/{id}`
   - Response: 200 OK with JSON body `{ "id": "integer", "name": "string" }`.
   - Response for non-existing student: 404 Not Found with error message.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the name field is missing in the creation request, return 400 Bad Request with a message detailing the error.

4. **Persistence**:
   - Use SQLite for data persistence.
   - Automatically create the database schema on application startup.

## Success Criteria (measurable, technology-agnostic)
- The application successfully starts without errors and can create a Student entry.
- A Student can be created with a valid name and retrieved using a unique ID.
- The application handles missing name input correctly by returning appropriate error messages.
- All API responses conform to the specified JSON format.
  
## Key Entities
- **Student**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (auto-generated by the database).
  - `name`: String (required).

## Assumptions
- A user will submit requests using an appropriate RESTful client or interface.
- The application will run in an environment where Python 3.11+ and SQLite are available.
- Users are familiar with submitting API requests and handling responses.

## Out of Scope
- Any functionality involving updating or deleting Student records.
- User authentication or authorization mechanisms.
- Frontend interface for the web application (only API endpoints are considered).
- Any additional fields or entities beyond the Student name field.
