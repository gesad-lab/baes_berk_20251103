# Feature: Add Email Field to Student Entity

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this feature is to enhance the existing Student entity by adding an email field, which will be a required string attribute. This addition aims to improve student management capabilities, allowing for contact information to be stored alongside other existing student data. By incorporating the email field, the application can facilitate future communication and ensure better management of student records.

## User Scenarios & Testing
1. **Create a Student with Email**:
   - A user submits a request to create a new student with a specified name and email.
   - The system returns a success response with the created student's details including the email.

2. **Retrieve a Student with Email**:
   - A user requests to retrieve a student by their ID.
   - The system returns the student's details including the name and email.

3. **Handle Invalid Email Input**:
   - A user submits a request to create a student without providing an email.
   - The system returns an appropriate error response indicating the required email field is missing.

### Testing Scenarios
- Test creating a Student with valid name and email input.
- Test creating a Student with missing name field.
- Test creating a Student with missing email field.
- Test retrieving an existing Student by ID including the email.
- Test retrieving a non-existent Student by ID.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Create Student**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /students`
   - Request body: `{ "name": "string", "email": "string" }` (Both fields are required)
   - Response: 201 Created with JSON body `{ "id": "integer", "name": "string", "email": "string" }`.

2. **Retrieve Student**:
   - Endpoint: `GET /students/{id}`
   - Response: 200 OK with JSON body `{ "id": "integer", "name": "string", "email": "string" }`.
   - Response for non-existing student: 404 Not Found with an error message.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the name field is missing in the creation request, return 400 Bad Request with a message detailing the error.
   - If the email field is missing in the creation request, return 400 Bad Request with a message detailing the error.

4. **Persistence**:
   - Update the existing Student entity in the database schema to include the email field.
   - Ensure that the database migration preserves existing Student data when adding this new field.

## Success Criteria (measurable, technology-agnostic)
- The application successfully starts without errors and can create a Student entry with both name and email.
- A Student can be created with valid name and email, and can be retrieved using a unique ID, which includes the email in the response.
- The application handles missing input correctly by returning appropriate error messages when either the name or email is not provided.
- All API responses conform to the specified JSON format.

## Key Entities
- **Student**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (auto-generated by the database).
  - `name`: String (required).
  - `email`: String (required).

## Assumptions
- A user will submit requests using an appropriate RESTful client or interface.
- The application will run in an environment where Python 3.11+ and SQLite are available.
- Users are familiar with submitting API requests and handling responses.

## Out of Scope
- Any functionality involving updating or deleting Student records.
- User authentication or authorization mechanisms.
- Frontend interface for the web application (only API endpoints are considered).
- Any additional fields or entities beyond the Student name and email fields.
