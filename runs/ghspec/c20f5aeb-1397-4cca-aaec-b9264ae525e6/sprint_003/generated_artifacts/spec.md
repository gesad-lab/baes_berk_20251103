# Feature: Create Course Entity

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this feature is to create a new Course entity within the existing system. This will enable the organization and categorization of courses offered, which is crucial for enhancing the educational offerings and managing curriculum efficiently. The Course entity will consist of a required name field, representing the title of the course, and a required level field that specifies the educational level of the course (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced). This addition supports improved course management for students and instructors.

## User Scenarios & Testing
1. **Create Course**:
   - A user can send a request to create a new Course entity, including the name and level fields.
   
   **Test**: Verify that a course can be successfully created with valid name and level data. The response should return the created course's data in JSON format.

2. **Retrieve Course**:
   - A user can send a request to return a specific course by its unique ID.
   
   **Test**: Verify that the response includes the course details (name and level) in JSON format.

3. **Invalid Course Handling**:
   - A user attempts to create a course with missing or invalid name or level fields.

   **Test**: Verify that the system responds with an error message indicating that both fields are required and cannot be empty.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Create Course Endpoint**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /courses` 
   - Request Body: JSON containing required fields "name" and "level" (e.g., `{"name": "Introduction to Programming", "level": "Beginner"}`)
   - Response: JSON representation of the created Course, including autogenerated ID, name, and level.

2. **Retrieve Specific Course Endpoint**:
   - Endpoint: `GET /courses/{id}`
   - Response: JSON representation of the specified Course entity, including ID, name, and level.

3. **Database Migration**:
   - Update the existing database schema to include a new `Course` table with the fields:
     - `name`: String (required)
     - `level`: String (required)
   - Ensure that there’s no loss of existing data in the `Student` table or its relationships during the migration process.

4. **Data Validation**:
   - Ensure that both name and level fields are non-empty strings. If either field is omitted or left empty, return a validation error.

## Success Criteria
1. An API endpoint (`POST /courses`) should successfully create a Course with valid name and level data and return a JSON response containing the new course's information within 2 seconds.
2. An API endpoint (`GET /courses/{id}`) should return the course's details (name and level) in JSON format within 2 seconds.
3. The application must handle invalid input (e.g., empty name or level fields) gracefully, returning appropriate error messages with a 400 status code.
4. The database migration must successfully create the Course table, ensuring the integrity of the existing Student records, without any data loss within 2 seconds.

## Key Entities
1. **Course**:
   - `id`: Integer (auto-incremented primary key)
   - `name`: String (required, cannot be empty)
   - `level`: String (required, cannot be empty)
   
## Assumptions
- The migration process will be tested in a staging environment to confirm there is no data loss for existing student or related entities.
- Users of the system will require the Course entity for effective course management, necessitating clear categorization of courses.
- Developers implementing this feature will have the previous environment and database structure in place, allowing for seamless integration of the new Course entity.

## Out of Scope
- Changes to the front-end interface for managing or displaying courses are not included in this feature specification.
- Any functionalities related to course enrollment, scheduling, or content delivery are not part of this enhancement; only the creation of the Course entity and its API representation is considered.
- Advanced data validation rules for the name and level fields beyond ensuring they are non-empty strings are outside the scope of this implementation.
