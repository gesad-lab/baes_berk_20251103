# This file is a placeholder for the virtual environment setup.
# To set up the virtual environment, please follow these instructions:

# 1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.
# 2. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
# 3. If you're using pipenv, you can create a virtual environment with:
#    pipenv install --dev Flask SQLAlchemy pytest
#    This will create a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock for dependency management.
#
# 4. If you prefer using virtualenv, install it if you haven't already:
#    pip install virtualenv
#
# 5. Create a virtual environment with the following command:
#    virtualenv venv
#    This will create a folder named 'venv' in your project directory with the environment.
#
# 6. To activate the virtual environment:
#    - On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
#    - On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
#
# 7. After activation, install Flask, SQLAlchemy, and pytest:
#    pip install Flask SQLAlchemy pytest
#
# 8. Once installed, ensure to document your environment setup in the README.md.

# Remember to deactivate your virtual environment when you're done:
# deactivate
