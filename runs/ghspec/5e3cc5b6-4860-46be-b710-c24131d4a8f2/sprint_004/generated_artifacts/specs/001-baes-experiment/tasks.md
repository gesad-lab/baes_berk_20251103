# Tasks: Add Course Relationship to Student Entity

---
## INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

Existing Code to Build Upon:
- `tests/test_student_course.py` (528 bytes)

## Task Breakdown

- [ ] **Task 1**: Update Student Model to Establish Course Relationship  
  **File**: `src/models/student.py`  
  Modify the Student model to add a relationship for accessing Course entities through a StudentCourse relationship. Ensure to import necessary SQLAlchemy components.

- [ ] **Task 2**: Update Course Model to Establish Student Relationship  
  **File**: `src/models/course.py`  
  Modify the Course model to add a relationship for accessing Student entities through a StudentCourse relationship. Ensure to import necessary SQLAlchemy components.

- [ ] **Task 3**: Create StudentCourse Relationship Model  
  **File**: `src/models/student_course.py`  
  Implement the new StudentCourse relationship model using SQLAlchemy to link students with courses.

- [ ] **Task 4**: Create Pydantic Schemas for Request/Response  
  **File**: `src/schemas/student_course_schema.py`  
  Define Pydantic schemas for the CourseAssociation (request body) and StudentResponse (response body) for associating courses with students.

- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement API Endpoints for Student-Course Association  
  **File**: `src/routes/student_course_routes.py`  
  Create endpoints to handle the POST and GET requests for associating courses with students. Ensure to implement input validation and proper response formats.

- [ ] **Task 6**: Update Main Application to Include New Routes  
  **File**: `src/main.py`  
  Modify the main application file to include the new routes from `student_course_routes.py`.

- [ ] **Task 7**: Create Migration Script for StudentCourse Table  
  **File**: `src/database/database.py`  
  Implement a migration script to add the `student_courses` table into the SQLite database, ensuring existing data remains intact.

- [ ] **Task 8**: Write Unit Tests for New Functionality  
  **File**: `tests/test_student_course.py`  
  Develop unit tests for the new student-course association feature, targeting API endpoints and model validation ensuring at least 70% coverage.

- [ ] **Task 9**: Update API Documentation  
  **File**: Automatically generated by FastAPI  
  Ensure that the new API routes are properly documented and accessible via Swagger UI.

- [ ] **Task 10**: Ensure Input Validation and Error Messages  
  **File**: `src/routes/student_course_routes.py`  
  Implement validation checks to handle invalid Course IDs and ensure proper error messages are returned in the format specified in the requirements.

### Summary of Expected Changes
- Modifications will mainly occur in the models for establishing relationships, the creation of schemas for request/response validation, the implementation of routing logic to handle the new endpoints, and the establishment of database migrations to support the new relationships. Tests will validate that the functionality works as intended and conforms to the MVP specifications.
