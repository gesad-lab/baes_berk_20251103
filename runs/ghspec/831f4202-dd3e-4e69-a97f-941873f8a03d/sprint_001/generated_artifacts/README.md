## Introduction

This project is built using FastAPI and SQLite. It is designed to provide a RESTful API with efficient data management using SQLAlchemy for ORM functionality. 

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (for database interactions)
- **Testing Framework**: pytest
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI (auto-generated by FastAPI)
- **Environment Management**: Poetry or pip with `requirements.txt`

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   Using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   Using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Initialize the SQLite database:

   This can be done via a command in your main application file or a dedicated script to create the database schema.

4. Run the application:

   You can start the FastAPI server by running:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Usage

The FastAPI framework includes auto-generated OpenAPI documentation accessible at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

This documentation provides a comprehensive reference for the available API endpoints, request parameters, and responses.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for this project:

1. Ensure you have all dependencies installed as per the Setup Instructions.
2. Use pytest to execute the tests:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
