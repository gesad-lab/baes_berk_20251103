To address the customer's task of creating a simple web application for a Student entity, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a "Website." This modality allows us to create an interactive web application that can handle user input and display JSON responses effectively. 

What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that a "Website" is a suitable product modality for this task. It allows for easy interaction with the API and provides a user-friendly interface for managing the Student entity. Additionally, it aligns well with the requirements of using FastAPI for the web application. 

Let's finalize this decision. What do you think?

Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup".

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure our application into multiple files following best practices. The application will also include a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter framework.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and the SQLite database.
   - `create_app()`: Initializes the FastAPI application and database.
   - `run()`: Starts the FastAPI server.

2. **models.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
   - `Student`: Defines the Student entity with a name field.

3. **database.py**: Manages the database connection and session.
   - `get_db()`: Provides a database session for each request.
   - `init_db()`: Initializes the database schema.

4. **routes.py**: Defines the API routes for the Student entity.
   - `create_student()`: Endpoint to create a new student.
   - `get_students()`: Endpoint to retrieve all students.

5. **gui.py**: Implements the GUI using Tkinter.
   - `StudentApp`: The main application class for the GUI.
   - `add_student()`: Method to add a student via the GUI.
   - `show_students()`: Method to display all students.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code is mostly well-structured, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it meets the requirements and best practices. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `routes.py`, the `BaseModel` from `pydantic` should be imported to define the response model properly.
   - The `create_student` function should accept a Pydantic model instead of a plain string for better validation.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `init_db` function should be called in `main.py` to ensure the database schema is created on startup.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are generally good, but the `create_student` and `get_students` methods could benefit from more detailed comments explaining their purpose and parameters.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The `create_student` function should handle cases where the name is empty or invalid, returning an appropriate HTTP error response.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is good, but the API should return JSON responses with proper status codes.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI should handle errors gracefully, informing the user if the student addition fails.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the `create_student` function does not validate the input properly, which could lead to errors if an empty name is submitted. Additionally, the database initialization is missing in `main.py`.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update `routes.py` to include input validation**:
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel, constr

   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: constr(min_length=1)  # Ensure name is not empty

   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = Student(name=student.name)
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
   ```

2. **Call `init_db()` in `main.py`**:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from database import init_db
   from routes import router

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.on_event("startup")
   def startup_event():
       init_db()  # Initialize the database schema

   app.include_router(router)
   ```

3. **Handle errors in the GUI**:
   - Update the `add_student` method in `gui.py` to handle potential errors from the API call.

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and user-friendly, ensuring it meets the requirements effectively.

### Final Comment:
Please make the suggested changes to ensure the application is fully functional and adheres to best practices.

Comments on Codes:
"The provided code is mostly well-structured, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it meets the requirements and best practices. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `routes.py`, the `BaseModel` from `pydantic` should be imported to define the response model properly.
   - The `create_student` function should accept a Pydantic model instead of a plain string for better validation.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `init_db` function should be called in `main.py` to ensure the database schema is created on startup.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are generally good, but the `create_student` and `get_students` methods could benefit from more detailed comments explaining their purpose and parameters.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The `create_student` function should handle cases where the name is empty or invalid, returning an appropriate HTTP error response.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is good, but the API should return JSON responses with proper status codes.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI should handle errors gracefully, informing the user if the student addition fails.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the `create_student` function does not validate the input properly, which could lead to errors if an empty name is submitted. Additionally, the database initialization is missing in `main.py`.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update `routes.py` to include input validation**:
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel, constr

   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: constr(min_length=1)  # Ensure name is not empty

   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = Student(name=student.name)
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
   ```

2. **Call `init_db()` in `main.py`**:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from database import init_db
   from routes import router

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.on_event("startup")
   def startup_event():
       init_db()  # Initialize the database schema

   app.include_router(router)
   ```

3. **Handle errors in the GUI**:
   - Update the `add_student` method in `gui.py` to handle potential errors from the API call.

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and user-friendly, ensuring it meets the requirements effectively.

### Final Comment:
Please make the suggested changes to ensure the application is fully functional and adheres to best practices."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - In routes.py, the BaseModel from pydantic should be imported to define the response model properly.\n   - The create_student function should accept a Pydantic model instead of a plain string for better validation.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - The init_db function should be called in main.py to ensure the database schema is created on startup.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - Comments are generally good, but the create_student and get_students methods could benefit from more detailed comments explaining their purpose and parameters.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The create_student function should handle cases where the name is empty or invalid, returning an appropriate HTTP error response.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The project structure is good, but the API should return JSON responses with proper status codes.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - The GUI should handle errors gracefully, informing the user if the student addition fails.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is that the create_student function does not validate the input properly, which could lead to errors if an empty name is submitted. Additionally, the database initialization is missing in main.py.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Update routes.py to include input validation:\n   python\n   from pydantic import BaseModel, constr\n\n   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: constr(min_length=1)  # Ensure name is not empty\n\n   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)\n   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_student = Student(name=student.name)\n       db.add(db_student)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_student)\n       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}\n\n\n2. Call init_db() in main.py:\n   python\n   from fastapi import FastAPI\n   from database import init_db\n   from routes import router\n\n   app = FastAPI()\n\n   @app.on_event("startup")\n   def startup_event():\n       init_db()  # Initialize the database schema\n\n   app.include_router(router)\n\n\n3. Handle errors in the GUI:\n   - Update the add_student method in gui.py to handle potential errors from the API call.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and user-friendly, ensuring it meets the requirements effectively.\n\n### Final Comment:\nPlease make the suggested changes to ensure the application is fully functional and adheres to best practices.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code structure and implementation are mostly correct, but there are some issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application operates smoothly and adheres to best practices. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations provided:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `FastAPI` app instance is missing in `main.py`. You need to create an instance of `FastAPI` and include the router from `routes.py`.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `init_db()` function in `database.py` is defined but never called. It should be called in `main.py` to ensure the database schema is created on startup.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are generally present, but it would be beneficial to add a comment in `main.py` to explain the purpose of the FastAPI app and the inclusion of routes.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors, but without the FastAPI app instance and the database initialization, it won't run correctly.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure and functionality mostly conform to the requirements, but the application won't start without the FastAPI app instance.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI implementation in `gui.py` is functional, but it relies on the FastAPI server being up and running. Ensure that the server is started before the GUI is used.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
The most critical issue is that the FastAPI application instance is missing in `main.py`, and the database initialization function `init_db()` is not called. This will prevent the application from running correctly.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Update `main.py` to include the FastAPI app instance and call `init_db()`**:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from routes import router
   from database import init_db

   app = FastAPI()

   # Initialize the database
   init_db()

   # Include the router for the API
   app.include_router(router)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       import uvicorn
       uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
   ```

2. **Ensure that the FastAPI server is running before launching the GUI**:
   - You may want to add instructions in your documentation to run the FastAPI server before starting the GUI application.

With these changes, the application should function correctly and meet all the requirements specified by the customer.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the application runs smoothly and meets best practices.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The FastAPI application is missing the main entry point to run the server, and the routes are not included in the main application file.**

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Add the FastAPI application instance and include the routes in `main.py`:**
   You need to create an instance of the FastAPI application and include the routes defined in `routes.py`. This is essential for the application to function correctly.

2. **Ensure the database is initialized on startup:**
   You should call the `init_db()` function to create the database schema when the application starts.

### Revised `main.py`:
```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from routes import router
from database import init_db

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize the database
init_db()

# Include the router for student routes
app.include_router(router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that you have `uvicorn` installed to run the FastAPI application.
- The GUI (`gui.py`) should be run separately from the FastAPI server, as they serve different purposes.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable, and users will be able to interact with it without losing any required features.

### Final Note:
Make sure to test the application after making these changes to confirm that all functionalities work as expected.

You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To address the error reported in the test summary, we need to ensure that the `tkinter` module is available in the environment where the application is being executed. The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'` indicates that the `tkinter` library is not installed or accessible.

Since the task does not specify changes to the logic of the application, we will focus on ensuring that the application can run without encountering this error. However, since `tkinter` is a standard library in Python, the issue may arise from the environment setup. 

To resolve this, we can provide instructions for the user to install the necessary packages or check their Python installation. Below are the modified codes with explanations:

### gui.py

### Explanation:
- The code remains unchanged as the error is related to the environment setup rather than the code itself. 

### Additional Instructions:
To resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError`, please ensure that you have Python installed correctly. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated. You can install `tkinter` using the following command if it is not already installed:

For Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

For Windows, `tkinter` should be included with the standard Python installation. If you encounter issues, consider reinstalling Python.

### Conclusion:
Since the error is environment-related and not code-related, there are no modifications needed in the source code. The application should work correctly once the environment is set up properly.

You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

It appears that the error reported is due to the absence of the `tkinter` module, which is a standard library for creating GUI applications in Python. This error typically occurs when the Python installation does not include the Tkinter library. To resolve this issue, we can provide instructions to ensure that Tkinter is installed correctly. However, since the task does not require modifying the existing code for the GUI, I will provide the necessary information for the user to resolve the issue.

Here are the instructions to ensure Tkinter is available:

```markdown
FILENAME
```plaintext
# Instructions to Install Tkinter
```
```
```plaintext
'''
To resolve the ModuleNotFoundError for Tkinter, ensure that Tkinter is installed.
For Windows, Tkinter is included with the standard Python installation.
For Linux, you may need to install it using your package manager.
For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
After installation, try running the application again.

Since no modifications to the source code are necessary based on the error summary, I will return the completion message.

- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:

- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found. This typically means that the Tkinter library is not installed or not available in the current Python environment. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that Tkinter is available. However, since the task is to modify the code based on the error summary, we can provide a check to ensure that the application can run without crashing if Tkinter is not available.

Here are the modified codes based on the error summary:

For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd student_app
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root of the project with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
