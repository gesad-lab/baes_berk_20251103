To meet the customer's requirements for a simple web application, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a Website. It allows us to create an interactive interface for the Student entity and can effectively handle JSON responses as required by the API. Additionally, a web application can be easily accessed by users through their browsers, making it user-friendly.

What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that a Website is a suitable product modality for this task. It aligns well with the requirements of creating a simple web application using FastAPI, and it provides a straightforward way to interact with the Student entity. The web interface can facilitate user input and display JSON responses effectively. 

Let's finalize this decision. What do you think?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup".

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure the application into multiple files. The core classes and functions will be organized as follows:

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and sets up the routes.
   - `create_app()`: Function to create and configure the FastAPI application.
   - `run()`: Function to run the application.

2. **models.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
   - `Student`: Class representing the Student entity with a name field.

3. **database.py**: Handles the database connection and session management.
   - `get_db()`: Dependency to get the database session.
   - `init_db()`: Function to initialize the database and create tables.

4. **schemas.py**: Defines the Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.
   - `StudentCreate`: Schema for creating a new student.
   - `StudentResponse`: Schema for returning student data.

5. **routers/student.py**: Contains the API routes related to the Student entity.
   - `create_student()`: Endpoint to create a new student.
   - `get_students()`: Endpoint to retrieve all students.

### File Structure

    ├── models.py
    ├── database.py
    ├── schemas.py

```

### Implementation

#### 1. main.py

```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''

from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import init_db
from routers import student

def create_app() -> FastAPI:
    app = FastAPI()

    init_db()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

#### 2. models.py

```python
'''
Database models for the application.
'''

from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from database import Base

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

#### 3. database.py

```python
'''
Database connection and session management.
'''

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"

Base = declarative_base()

def get_db() -> Session:
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

def init_db() -> None:
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

#### 4. schemas.py

```python
'''
Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.
'''

from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str

class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

#### 5. routers/student.py

```python
'''
API routes for the Student entity.
'''

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Summary

This implementation provides a simple web application using FastAPI, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy. The application allows users to create and retrieve students with a name field. The database schema is created automatically on startup, and all API responses are in JSON format. 

To run the application, ensure you have the necessary packages installed (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `sqlalchemy`, and `pydantic`) and execute the `main.py` file. The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have assessed it against the regulations outlined. Here are the findings:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: All necessary classes and functions are imported correctly in each module.
2. **All methods should be implemented**: All methods are implemented as required.
3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present, but some methods could benefit from additional clarity in their comments.
4. **No potential bugs**: The code appears to be free of syntax errors and logical bugs.
5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project meets the requirements specified by the user.
6. **User interaction with the generated software**: The API endpoints are correctly set up for interaction.

**Comment with the highest priority**: The `create_student` function in `student.py` does not handle potential exceptions that may arise during database operations, such as integrity errors when trying to insert a duplicate student name. This could lead to unhandled exceptions and a poor user experience.

**Suggestions for revision**:
To improve the robustness of the `create_student` function, you should add exception handling to catch potential database errors. Here’s how you can modify the function:

```python
@router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    try:
        db_student = Student(name=student.name)
        db.add(db_student)
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(db_student)
        return db_student
    except Exception as e:
        db.rollback()  # Rollback the session in case of error
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))  # Return a proper error response
```

This modification ensures that if an error occurs during the database operation, the session is rolled back, and a meaningful error message is returned to the user.

Overall, the code is well-structured, but adding error handling will significantly enhance its robustness and user experience.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes for the web application, structured according to the specified format and ensuring that best practices are followed. Each file is formatted with the required tokens replaced accordingly.

1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application operates correctly according to the requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
In the `create_student` function within `student.py`, the response model is returning the `db_student` object directly. However, it should return an instance of `StudentResponse` to ensure that the response conforms to the expected schema. This could lead to issues when the API is called, as the response may not match the defined structure.

### Suggested Revision:
Modify the `create_student` function to return an instance of `StudentResponse` instead of the `db_student` object directly. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
@router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return StudentResponse(id=db_student.id, name=db_student.name)  # Return the response model
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Change the return statement in the `create_student` function to create and return a `StudentResponse` instance.

By implementing this change, the API will correctly return the expected JSON response format, ensuring compliance with the requirements.

If you implement this change, the application should function correctly as intended.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the import statements in the `student.py` file. The `StudentCreate` and `StudentResponse` schemas are referenced but not imported, which will lead to a `NameError` when the API endpoints are called.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Imports in `student.py`:** The `StudentCreate` and `StudentResponse` classes from the `schemas` module are not imported, which will cause the application to fail when trying to create or retrieve students.

### Suggested Revision:
To fix this issue, you need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the `student.py` file:

```python
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse
```

### Revised `student.py`:
```python
'''
API routes for the Student entity.
'''
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse  # Add this line
router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

After making this change, the application should function correctly, allowing users to interact with the API without encountering import-related errors.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the import statements in the `student.py` file. The `StudentCreate` and `StudentResponse` schemas are referenced but not imported, which will lead to a `NameError` when the API endpoints are called.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Imports in `student.py`:** The `StudentCreate` and `StudentResponse` classes from the `schemas` module are not imported, which will cause the application to fail when trying to create or retrieve students.

### Suggested Revision:
To fix this issue, you need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the `student.py` file:

```python
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse
```

### Revised `student.py`:
```python
'''
API routes for the Student entity.
'''
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse  # Add this line
router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

After making this change, the application should function correctly, allowing users to interact with the API without encountering import-related errors.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that there is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `routers` module in `main.py`. This suggests that the `routers` directory is either missing or not structured correctly. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the `student.py` file is located in a directory named `routers`. 

Here’s how we can modify the code to ensure it works correctly:

1. Create a directory named `routers` and place the `student.py` file inside it.
2. Update the import statement in `main.py` to reflect the correct module path.

Here are the modified codes based on the error summary:

**main.py**
```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import init_db
from routers.student import router  # Updated import statement to reflect the correct path
def create_app() -> FastAPI:
    app = FastAPI()
    app.include_router(router)  # Use the imported router
    return app
app = create_app()
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    init_db()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

**student.py**
```python
'''
API routes for the Student entity.
'''
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse  # Added import statements
router = APIRouter()
@router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student
@router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

With these changes, the application should now be able to find the `student` router correctly, and the error should be resolved.

You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To resolve the issue reported in the test summary, we need to ensure that the `routers` module is correctly structured and accessible. The error indicates that the `routers` module could not be found, which suggests that the directory structure may not be set up correctly or the import statement needs to be adjusted. 

Here’s the corrected code for the `main.py` file, ensuring that the import statement for the `student` router is correctly referencing the `routers` directory:

main.py
```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import init_db
from routers.student import router  # Adjusted import statement
def create_app() -> FastAPI:
    app = FastAPI()
    app.include_router(router)  # Using the imported router
    return app
app = create_app()
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    init_db()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- The import statement for the `student` router was changed from `from routers import student` to `from routers.student import router`. This ensures that we are correctly importing the `router` object from the `student` module located in the `routers` package.

With this change, the application should now be able to find the `student` router, and the error should be resolved.

If there are no further issues, the application should run smoothly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that there is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `routers` module in the `main.py` file. This suggests that the `routers` directory or file structure is not correctly set up. To resolve this, we need to ensure that the `student.py` file is correctly placed in a `routers` directory. 

Here are the modifications based on the error summary:

1. Ensure that the `student.py` file is located in a folder named `routers`.
2. Update the import statement in `main.py` to reflect the correct path.

Here are the modified codes:

**main.py**
```python

from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import init_db
from routers.student import router  # Updated import statement to reflect the correct path

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in the FastAPI application, the `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary dependencies for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and an ASGI server like Uvicorn. Here’s how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.7
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization with FastAPI.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers based on the latest stable releases if necessary, but the versions provided above are compatible with Python 3.11+.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries used in the FastAPI application, the `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary dependencies for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and an ASGI server like Uvicorn. Here’s how the `requirements.txt` file should look:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.7
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization with FastAPI.
Make sure to adjust the version numbers based on the latest stable releases if necessary, but the versions provided above are compatible with Python 3.11+. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

   - ReDoc: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

## How to Use the API

### Create a Student

To create a new student, send a POST request to `/students/` with a JSON body containing the student's name.

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe"}'
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

### Retrieve Students

To retrieve a list of students, send a GET request to `/students/`. You can also use query parameters to paginate the results.

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/?skip=0&limit=10"
```

**Example Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
