To address the customer's task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves database schema updates and potentially visualizing relationships, I believe a Dashboard could be a suitable product modality. It would allow us to visualize the relationships between Courses and Teachers in real-time, making it easier for users to understand the connections.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think another modality might be more appropriate?

I appreciate your input on the Dashboard as a potential product modality. However, I believe that a Document might be more suitable for this task. It would allow us to provide detailed documentation of the changes made to the database schema, including the relationship between Courses and Teachers, along with any necessary migration steps. This would ensure that the customer has a clear understanding of the implementation process.

What do you think about this perspective? Would you prefer to stick with the Dashboard, or do you see the value in a Document as well?

I see the value in your perspective on using a Document. It would indeed provide a comprehensive overview of the changes, including the database schema updates and migration steps, which is crucial for the customer’s understanding and implementation.

However, I still believe that a Dashboard could complement the Document by providing a visual representation of the relationships in real-time. This could enhance the user experience by allowing them to see the connections dynamically.

That said, if we prioritize clarity and detailed documentation for the customer, I can agree that a Document might be the better choice. What do you think about potentially combining both modalities, or do you feel strongly about focusing solely on the Document?

This dual approach would cater to different user needs—those who prefer detailed documentation and those who benefit from visual insights. 

If we can agree on this combination, we can move forward with a clear plan. What do you think? Shall we finalize this approach?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a solid structure, but there are a few critical areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Definition in Course Model:**
The `Course` model does not currently have a relationship defined for the `Teacher` entity. This is essential to establish the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`, allowing a course to have a teacher.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py` to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model and define the relationship.**

Here’s how you can modify the `Course` model:

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True)  # Add foreign key for Teacher
    students = relationship('Student', secondary=student_courses, back_populates='courses')
    teacher = relationship('Teacher', back_populates='courses')  # Define the relationship to Teacher
```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model to include a back-reference to the `Course` model:**

```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field
    courses = relationship('Course', back_populates='teacher')  # Add back-reference to Course
```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas in `schemas.py` to include the teacher information:**

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add teacher_id to associate with a teacher

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Include teacher_id in the response
```

4. **Update the `create_course` endpoint in `main.py` to handle the teacher relationship:**

```python
@app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Include teacher_id
    db.add(db_course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_course)
    return db_course
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, you will establish a proper relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities, fulfilling the customer's requirements. Ensure to run the migration script after making these changes to update the database schema accordingly.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a solid structure, but there are a few critical areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Definition in Course Model:**
The `Course` model does not currently have a relationship defined for the `Teacher` entity. This is essential to establish the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`, allowing a course to have a teacher.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py` to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model and define the relationship.**

Here’s how you can modify the `Course` model:

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True)  # Add foreign key for Teacher
    students = relationship('Student', secondary=student_courses, back_populates='courses')
    teacher = relationship('Teacher', back_populates='courses')  # Define the relationship to Teacher
```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model to include a back-reference to the `Course` model:**

```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field
    courses = relationship('Course', back_populates='teacher')  # Add back-reference to Course
```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas in `schemas.py` to include the teacher information:**

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add teacher_id to associate with a teacher

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Include teacher_id in the response
```

4. **Update the `create_course` endpoint in `main.py` to handle the teacher relationship:**

```python
@app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Include teacher_id
    db.add(db_course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_course)
    return db_course
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, you will establish a proper relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities, fulfilling the customer's requirements. Ensure to run the migration script after making these changes to update the database schema accordingly.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

This is essential to establish the relationship between Course and Teacher, allowing a course to have a teacher.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Update the Course model in models.py to include a foreign key reference to the Teacher model and define the relationship.\n\nHere’s how you can modify the Course model:\n\npython\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field\n    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\'teachers.id\'), nullable=True)  # Add foreign key for Teacher\n    students = relationship(\'Student\', secondary=student_courses, back_populates=\'courses\')\n    teacher = relationship(\'Teacher\', back_populates=\'courses\')  # Define the relationship to Teacher\n\n\n2. Update the Teacher model to include a back-reference to the Course model:\n\npython\nclass Teacher(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'teachers\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Required field\n    courses = relationship(\'Course\', back_populates=\'teacher\')  # Add back-reference to Course\n\n\n3. Update the CourseCreate and CourseResponse schemas in schemas.py to include the teacher information:\n\npython\nclass CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n    level: str\n    teacher_id: int  # Add teacher_id to associate with a teacher\n\nclass CourseResponse(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    level: str\n    teacher_id: int  # Include teacher_id in the response\n\n\n4. Update the create_course endpoint in main.py to handle the teacher relationship:\n\npython\n@app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)\ndef create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Include teacher_id\n    db.add(db_course)\n    db.commit()\n    db.refresh(db_course)\n    return db_course\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy implementing these changes, you will establish a proper relationship between the Course and Teacher entities, fulfilling the customer\'s requirements. Ensure to run the migration script after making these changes to update the database schema accordingly.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script that could potentially lead to data loss or inconsistency. Here’s the highest priority comment and suggestion for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py` does not handle the creation of the `Teacher` table properly before adding the foreign key reference in the `Course` table. If the `Teacher` table does not exist when the `Course` table is created, it will lead to a foreign key constraint error.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Ensure that the `Teacher` table is created before the `Course` table in the `upgrade` function.
2. Modify the `upgrade` function to create the `Teacher` table first, followed by the `Course` table.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade(db: Session):
    with db.begin():
        # Check if the email column already exists to avoid errors
        if not db.has_table('students'):
            raise Exception("Students table does not exist.")
        # Check if the email column exists
        inspector = inspect(db.bind)
        columns = [column['name'] for column in inspector.get_columns('students')]
        if 'email' not in columns:
            # Add email column to the existing Student table
            db.execute('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR')  # No default value, existing data will remain intact
        
        # Create Teacher table first
        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        
        # Create Course table
        Course.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        
        # Create association table for Student and Course
        student_courses.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
```

### Summary of Changes:
- The `Teacher` table creation is moved before the `Course` table creation to ensure that the foreign key reference in the `Course` table is valid.

By implementing this change, you will ensure that the database migration script works correctly and preserves existing data without introducing potential bugs related to foreign key constraints.

Please make this adjustment and re-run the migration to ensure everything functions as expected.

        if 'email' not in columns:

        # Create association table for Student and Course

If the Teacher table does not exist when the Course table is created, it will lead to a foreign key constraint error.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Ensure that the Teacher table is created before the Course table in the upgrade function.\n2. Modify the upgrade function to create the Teacher table first, followed by the Course table.\n\nHere’s how you can revise the upgrade function:\n\npython\ndef upgrade(db: Session):\n    with db.begin():\n        # Check if the email column already exists to avoid errors\n        if not db.has_table(\'students\'):\n            raise Exception("Students table does not exist.")\n        # Check if the email column exists\n        inspector = inspect(db.bind)\n        columns = [column[\'name\'] for column in inspector.get_columns(\'students\')]\n        if \'email\' not in columns:\n            # Add email column to the existing Student table\n            db.execute(\'ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR\')  # No default value, existing data will remain intact\n        \n        # Create Teacher table first\n        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)\n        \n        # Create Course table\n        Course.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)\n        \n        # Create association table for Student and Course\n        student_courses.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)\n\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n- The Teacher table creation is moved before the Course table creation to ensure that the foreign key reference in the Course table is valid.\n\nBy implementing this change, you will ensure that the database migration script works correctly and preserves existing data without introducing potential bugs related to foreign key constraints.\n\nPlease make this adjustment and re-run the migration to ensure everything functions as expected.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script that could potentially lead to data loss or inconsistency. Here’s the highest priority comment and suggestion for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py` does not handle the creation of the `Teacher` table properly before adding the foreign key reference in the `Course` table. If the `Teacher` table does not exist when the `Course` table is created, it will lead to a foreign key constraint error.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Ensure that the `Teacher` table is created before the `Course` table in the `upgrade` function.
2. Modify the `upgrade` function to create the `Teacher` table first, followed by the `Course` table.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade(db: Session):
    with db.begin():
        # Check if the email column already exists to avoid errors
        if not db.has_table('students'):
            raise Exception("Students table does not exist.")
        # Check if the email column exists
        inspector = inspect(db.bind)
        columns = [column['name'] for column in inspector.get_columns('students')]
        if 'email' not in columns:
            # Add email column to the existing Student table
            db.execute('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR')  # No default value, existing data will remain intact
        
        # Create Teacher table first
        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        
        # Create Course table
        Course.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        
        # Create association table for Student and Course
        student_courses.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
```

### Summary of Changes:
- The `Teacher` table creation is moved before the `Course` table creation to ensure that the foreign key reference in the `Course` table is valid.

By implementing this change, you will ensure that the database migration script works correctly and preserves existing data without introducing potential bugs related to foreign key constraints.

Please make this adjustment and re-run the migration to ensure everything functions as expected."

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

If the Teacher table does not exist when the Course table is created, it will lead to a foreign key constraint error.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Ensure that the Teacher table is created before the Course table in the upgrade function.\n2.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure that the software operates correctly according to the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `migration_script.py` does not include the necessary logic to add the foreign key relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities in the database schema. While the `Teacher` table is created, the migration does not ensure that the `teacher_id` column in the `Course` table is properly set up with a foreign key constraint referencing the `Teacher` table. This could lead to integrity issues when associating courses with teachers.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py`** to include the creation of the foreign key constraint for the `teacher_id` column in the `Course` table. Here’s how you can modify the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade(db: Session):
    with db.begin():
        # Check if the email column already exists to avoid errors
        if not db.has_table('students'):
            raise Exception("Students table does not exist.")
        # Check if the email column exists
        inspector = inspect(db.bind)
        columns = [column['name'] for column in inspector.get_columns('students')]
        if 'email' not in columns:
            # Add email column to the existing Student table
            db.execute('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR')  # No default value, existing data will remain intact
        # Create Teacher table first
        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        # Create Course table with foreign key constraint
        Course.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        # Create association table for Student and Course
        student_courses.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        # Add foreign key constraint for teacher_id in Course table
        db.execute('ALTER TABLE courses ADD CONSTRAINT fk_teacher FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers(id) ON DELETE SET NULL')
```

This modification ensures that the `teacher_id` column in the `Course` table is properly linked to the `id` column in the `Teacher` table, allowing for the intended relationship to function correctly.

### Conclusion:
After implementing this change, the database migration will correctly set up the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`, preserving existing data and ensuring that the application adheres to the user's requirements.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

        # Create Teacher table first

        # Create Course table with foreign key constraint

        # Create association table for Student and Course
        student_courses.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        # Add foreign key constraint for teacher_id in Course table
        db.execute('ALTER TABLE courses ADD CONSTRAINT fk_teacher FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers(id) ON DELETE SET NULL')

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `migration_script.py` does not include the necessary logic to add the foreign key relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities in the database schema. While the `Teacher` table is created, the migration does not ensure that the `teacher_id` column in the `Course` table is properly set up with a foreign key constraint referencing the `Teacher` table. This could lead to integrity issues when associating courses with teachers.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py`** to include the creation of the foreign key constraint for the `teacher_id` column in the `Course` table. Here’s how you can modify the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade(db: Session):
    with db.begin():
        # Check if the email column already exists to avoid errors
        if not db.has_table('students'):
            raise Exception("Students table does not exist.")
        # Check if the email column exists
        inspector = inspect(db.bind)
        columns = [column['name'] for column in inspector.get_columns('students')]
        if 'email' not in columns:
            # Add email column to the existing Student table
            db.execute('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR')  # No default value, existing data will remain intact
        # Create Teacher table first
        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        # Create Course table with foreign key constraint
        Course.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        # Create association table for Student and Course
        student_courses.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
        # Add foreign key constraint for teacher_id in Course table
        db.execute('ALTER TABLE courses ADD CONSTRAINT fk_teacher FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers(id) ON DELETE SET NULL')
```

This modification ensures that the `teacher_id` column in the `Course` table is properly linked to the `id` column in the `Teacher` table, allowing for the intended relationship to function correctly.

### Conclusion:
After implementing this change, the database migration will correctly set up the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`, preserving existing data and ensuring that the application adheres to the user's requirements.

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary changes implemented according to the comments provided. The foreign key constraint for the `teacher_id` in the `Course` table has been added to ensure the integrity of the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project to run properly:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.4

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to create the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
Make sure to adjust the version numbers based on your specific requirements or the latest stable versions available at the time of installation. You can install the dependencies using the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
