To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we should consider the most effective product modality that can present this information clearly and efficiently. 

Given the nature of the Course entity, which includes structured data (name and level), a database or application might be the most suitable option. However, we could also consider a dashboard for visualizing courses if we want to present multiple courses and their levels dynamically.

What are your thoughts on this? Should we lean towards a database application or a dashboard, or do you have another modality in mind?

I agree that a database application would be a strong choice for this task, as it allows us to create, manage, and manipulate the Course entity effectively while preserving existing Student data. Additionally, it provides the necessary structure for handling the required fields (name and level) and can be easily integrated into a larger system if needed.

While a dashboard could be useful for visualizing multiple courses, it may not be as effective for the initial creation and management of the Course entity. Therefore, I believe focusing on a database application is the best approach.

What do you think? Should we proceed with the database application?

I completely agree with your assessment. A database application is indeed the most suitable choice for creating and managing the Course entity effectively. It allows us to handle the required fields while ensuring that existing Student data is preserved during the migration process. 

Focusing on a database application will provide the necessary structure and functionality for the customer's needs. Let's proceed with this decision.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Code Review

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` class is not defined or imported in any of the provided files. This is a critical issue since the task requires creating a `Course` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There are no methods implemented for creating, retrieving, or managing the `Course` entity.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Since there are no methods for the `Course` entity, this point is not applicable.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code does not contain any obvious bugs, but the absence of the `Course` entity and its related methods is a significant oversight.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project does not conform to the user's task as the `Course` entity is missing.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The current implementation only allows for student management and does not incorporate any functionality for courses.

### Highest Priority Comment
**The most critical issue is the absence of the `Course` entity and its related functionality, which is essential to meet the user's requirements.**

### Suggestions for Revision
1. **Define the `Course` model**: Create a new `Course` class in `models.py` similar to the `Student` class.
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a new schema for `Course`**: Add a new schema in `schemas.py` for creating and responding with `Course` data.
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement API routes for `Course`**: Create a new router file (e.g., `course_router.py`) to handle course-related API routes similar to `student_router.py`.
   ```python
   from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
   from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
   from database import SessionLocal
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

   router = APIRouter()

   @router.post("/courses", response_model=CourseResponse, status_code=201)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate):
       with SessionLocal() as db:
           db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
           db.add(db_course)
           db.commit()
           db.refresh(db_course)
           return db_course
   ```

4. **Update the main application**: Include the new `course_router` in `main.py`.
   ```python
   from course_router import router as course_router
   app.include_router(course_router)
   ```

5. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new `Course` table without affecting existing `Student` data. You can use Alembic for migrations or manually create the table in a migration script.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements for managing courses alongside students.

### Final Note
Please proceed with the suggested changes to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs.

           db.commit()
           db.refresh(db_course)
           return db_course
   ```

4. **Update the main application**: Include the new `course_router` in `main.py`.
   ```python
   from course_router import router as course_router
   app.include_router(course_router)
   ```

5. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new `Course` table without affecting existing `Student` data. You can use Alembic for migrations or manually create the table in a migration script.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements for managing courses alongside students.

Comments on Codes:
"### Code Review

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` class is not defined or imported in any of the provided files. This is a critical issue since the task requires creating a `Course` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There are no methods implemented for creating, retrieving, or managing the `Course` entity.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Since there are no methods for the `Course` entity, this point is not applicable.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code does not contain any obvious bugs, but the absence of the `Course` entity and its related methods is a significant oversight.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project does not conform to the user's task as the `Course` entity is missing.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The current implementation only allows for student management and does not incorporate any functionality for courses.

### Highest Priority Comment
**The most critical issue is the absence of the `Course` entity and its related functionality, which is essential to meet the user's requirements.**

### Suggestions for Revision
1. **Define the `Course` model**: Create a new `Course` class in `models.py` similar to the `Student` class.
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a new schema for `Course`**: Add a new schema in `schemas.py` for creating and responding with `Course` data.
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement API routes for `Course`**: Create a new router file (e.g., `course_router.py`) to handle course-related API routes similar to `student_router.py`.
   ```python
   from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
   from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
   from database import SessionLocal
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

   router = APIRouter()

   @router.post("/courses", response_model=CourseResponse, status_code=201)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate):
       with SessionLocal() as db:
           db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
           db.add(db_course)
           db.commit()
           db.refresh(db_course)
           return db_course
   ```

4. **Update the main application**: Include the new `course_router` in `main.py`.
   ```python
   from course_router import router as course_router
   app.include_router(course_router)
   ```

5. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new `Course` table without affecting existing `Student` data. You can use Alembic for migrations or manually create the table in a migration script.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements for managing courses alongside students.

### Final Note
Please proceed with the suggested changes to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs."

Define the Course model: Create a new Course class in models.py similar to the Student class.\n   python\n   from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String\n\n   class Course(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Create a new schema for Course: Add a new schema in schemas.py for creating and responding with Course data.\n   python\n   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       level: str\n\n   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       level: str\n\n       class Config:\n           orm_mode = True\n\n\n3. Implement API routes for Course: Create a new router file (e.g., course_router.py) to handle course-related API routes similar to student_router.py.\n   python\n   from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import Session\n   from database import SessionLocal\n   from models import Course\n   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse\n\n   router = APIRouter()\n\n   @router.post("/courses", response_model=CourseResponse, status_code=201)\n   def create_course(course: CourseCreate):\n       with SessionLocal() as db:\n           db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)\n           db.add(db_course)\n           db.commit()\n           db.refresh(db_course)\n           return db_course\n\n\n4. Update the main application: Include the new course_router in main.py.\n   python\n   from course_router import router as course_router\n   app.include_router(course_router)\n\n\n5. Database Migration: Ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new Course table without affecting existing Student data. You can use Alembic for migrations or manually create the table in a migration script.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the user\'s requirements for managing courses alongside students.\n\n### Final Note\nPlease proceed with the suggested changes to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer\'s needs.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements set forth by the customer. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the functionality of the application.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic**: The migration script (`migration.py`) does not specifically handle the creation of the `Course` table. While the `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` line will create all tables defined in the models, it is important to ensure that the migration script is explicitly clear about its purpose and that it is run after the `Course` model is defined. Additionally, there should be a mechanism to ensure that existing data in the `Student` table is preserved during migrations.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the Migration Script**: Modify the `migration.py` to specifically mention that it is for adding the `Course` table and ensure it is clear in the comments. You may also want to add a check to see if the `courses` table already exists before trying to create it.

   ```python
   '''
   Migration script to add Course table to the database.
   This script ensures that the Course table is created without affecting existing Student data.
   '''
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, inspect
   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
   from models import Base

   DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
   engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
   SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

   # Create the Course table if it does not exist
   inspector = inspect(engine)
   if 'courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
       Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
   ```

2. **Ensure Consistency in Imports**: Make sure that all necessary imports are included in each file where they are needed. For example, in `course_router.py`, ensure that `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` are imported from `schemas`.

3. **Testing**: After making these changes, ensure to run tests to verify that both the `Student` and `Course` functionalities work as expected and that no data is lost during migrations.

4. **Documentation**: Update the comments in the code to reflect the purpose of each section clearly, especially in the migration scripts and routers.

By addressing these points, the application will be more robust, and the migration process will be clearer and safer for existing data.

If you implement these suggestions, the code will be better aligned with the requirements and regulations set forth by ChatDev.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements set forth by the customer. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the functionality of the application.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic**: The migration script (`migration.py`) does not specifically handle the creation of the `Course` table. While the `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` line will create all tables defined in the models, it is important to ensure that the migration script is explicitly clear about its purpose and that it is run after the `Course` model is defined. Additionally, there should be a mechanism to ensure that existing data in the `Student` table is preserved during migrations.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the Migration Script**: Modify the `migration.py` to specifically mention that it is for adding the `Course` table and ensure it is clear in the comments. You may also want to add a check to see if the `courses` table already exists before trying to create it.

   ```python
   '''
   Migration script to add Course table to the database.
   This script ensures that the Course table is created without affecting existing Student data.
   '''
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, inspect
   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
   from models import Base

   DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
   engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
   SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

   # Create the Course table if it does not exist
   inspector = inspect(engine)
   if 'courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
       Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
   ```

2. **Ensure Consistency in Imports**: Make sure that all necessary imports are included in each file where they are needed. For example, in `course_router.py`, ensure that `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` are imported from `schemas`.

3. **Testing**: After making these changes, ensure to run tests to verify that both the `Student` and `Course` functionalities work as expected and that no data is lost during migrations.

4. **Documentation**: Update the comments in the code to reflect the purpose of each section clearly, especially in the migration scripts and routers.

By addressing these points, the application will be more robust, and the migration process will be clearer and safer for existing data.

If you implement these suggestions, the code will be better aligned with the requirements and regulations set forth by ChatDev."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the functionality of the application.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nDatabase Migration Logic: The migration script (migration.py) does not specifically handle the creation of the Course table. While the Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine) line will create all tables defined in the models, it is important to ensure that the migration script is explicitly clear about its purpose and that it is run after the Course model is defined. Additionally, there should be a mechanism to ensure that existing data in the Student table is preserved during migrations.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Update the Migration Script: Modify the migration.py to specifically mention that it is for adding the Course table and ensure it is clear in the comments. You may also want to add a check to see if the courses table already exists before trying to create it.\n\n   python\n   \'\'\'\n   Migration script to add Course table to the database.\n   This script ensures that the Course table is created without affecting existing Student data.\n   \'\'\'\n   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, inspect\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n   from models import Base\n\n   DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"\n   engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})\n   SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)\n\n   # Create the Course table if it does not exist\n   inspector = inspect(engine)\n   if \'courses\' not in inspector.get_table_names():\n       Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)\n\n\n2. Ensure Consistency in Imports: Make sure that all necessary imports are included in each file where they are needed. For example, in course_router.py, ensure that CourseCreate and CourseResponse are imported from schemas.\n\n3. Testing: After making these changes, ensure to run tests to verify that both the Student and Course functionalities work as expected and that no data is lost during migrations.\n\n4. Documentation: Update the comments in the code to reflect the purpose of each section clearly, especially in the migration scripts and routers.\n\nBy addressing these points, the application will be more robust, and the migration process will be clearer and safer for existing data.\n\nIf you implement these suggestions, the code will be better aligned with the requirements and regulations set forth by ChatDev.'} |

- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for creating a Course entity and ensuring that the existing Student data is preserved during the migration. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `migration.py` script does not explicitly handle the creation of the Course table correctly. While it checks if the 'courses' table exists, it does not ensure that the `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` is called only for the Course table. This could lead to unintended consequences if the schema changes in the future.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `migration.py` script** to ensure that it only creates the Course table without affecting the existing Student data. You can do this by explicitly defining the Course model and creating only that table if it does not exist.

Here’s how you can revise the `migration.py`:

```python
'''
Migration script to add Course table to the database.
This script ensures that the Course table is created without affecting existing Student data.
'''
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, inspect
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from models import Course  # Import the Course model
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

# Create the Course table if it does not exist
inspector = inspect(engine)
if 'courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
    Course.__table__.create(bind=engine)  # Create only the Course table
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that the `Course` model is imported in any file where it is referenced.
- Consider adding error handling in the `create_course` method to manage potential database errors gracefully.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process is more robust and adheres to the requirements set forth by the customer.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements for creating a Course entity and ensuring that the existing Student data is preserved during the migration. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `migration.py` script does not explicitly handle the creation of the Course table correctly. While it checks if the 'courses' table exists, it does not ensure that the `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` is called only for the Course table. This could lead to unintended consequences if the schema changes in the future.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `migration.py` script** to ensure that it only creates the Course table without affecting the existing Student data. You can do this by explicitly defining the Course model and creating only that table if it does not exist.

Here’s how you can revise the `migration.py`:

```python
'''
Migration script to add Course table to the database.
This script ensures that the Course table is created without affecting existing Student data.
'''
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, inspect
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from models import Course  # Import the Course model
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

# Create the Course table if it does not exist
inspector = inspect(engine)
if 'courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
    Course.__table__.create(bind=engine)  # Create only the Course table
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that the `Course` model is imported in any file where it is referenced.
- Consider adding error handling in the `create_course` method to manage potential database errors gracefully.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process is more robust and adheres to the requirements set forth by the customer.

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# Course Management System

A simple application for managing students and courses using FastAPI and SQLite.

## Main Functions

This application provides the following functionalities:

- **Student Management**: Create and manage student records, including their names and emails.
- **Course Management**: Create and manage course records, including course names and levels.
- **Database Persistence**: All data is stored in a SQLite database, ensuring data is preserved across sessions.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Environment Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for the application:

- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management, particularly for request and response schemas.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to interact with the API.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project's needs or the latest stable releases if necessary.

## How to Use the Application

### Running the API

1. **Start the FastAPI application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Interacting with the API

You can interact with the API using tools like Postman, cURL, or through the provided GUI.

#### Using the GUI

1. **Run the GUI application**:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

2. **Add a Student**:
   - Enter the student's name and email in the respective fields.
   - Click the "Add Student" button to submit the data.

3. **Add a Course**:
   You can extend the GUI to include functionality for adding courses by creating a similar interface as the student management.

### API Endpoints

- **Create Student**: 
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /students`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```

- **Create Course**:
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /courses`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "level": "Beginner"
    }
    ```

### Database Migration

The application includes a migration script (`migration.py`) that ensures the Course table is created without affecting existing Student data. You can run this script to apply the migration.

## Conclusion

This Course Management System provides a simple yet effective way to manage students and courses. You can extend its functionality as needed to suit your requirements. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.

- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management, particularly for request and response schemas.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to interact with the API.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project's needs or the latest stable releases if necessary.

## How to Use the Application

### Running the API

1. **Start the FastAPI application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Interacting with the API

You can interact with the API using tools like Postman, cURL, or through the provided GUI.

#### Using the GUI

1. **Run the GUI application**:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

2. **Add a Student**:
   - Enter the student's name and email in the respective fields.
   - Click the "Add Student" button to submit the data.

3. **Add a Course**:
   You can extend the GUI to include functionality for adding courses by creating a similar interface as the student management.

### API Endpoints

- **Create Student**: 
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /students`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```

- **Create Course**:
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /courses`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "level": "Beginner"
    }
    ```

### Database Migration

The application includes a migration script (`migration.py`) that ensures the Course table is created without affecting existing Student data. You can run this script to apply the migration.

## Conclusion

This Course Management System provides a simple yet effective way to manage students and courses. You can extend its functionality as needed to suit your requirements. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
