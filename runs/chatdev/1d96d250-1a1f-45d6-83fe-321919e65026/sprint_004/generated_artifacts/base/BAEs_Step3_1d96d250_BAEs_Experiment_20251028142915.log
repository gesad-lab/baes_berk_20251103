To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. Given the simplicity of the data structure (name and level fields), I believe a few modalities could work well. 

1. **Document**: This could be a straightforward way to present the Course entity, allowing for clear documentation of the fields and their requirements.

2. **Website**: A web-based presentation could allow for interactive elements, such as forms for entering Course data, which could enhance user engagement.

3. **Dashboard**: If we want to visualize multiple Course entities and their levels, a dashboard could provide a dynamic view of this data, especially if we plan to expand on this in the future.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you have a preference or any other modalities in mind?

I appreciate your insights on the potential modalities. Here are my thoughts on each:

1. **Document**: While this is a clear and straightforward option, it may lack interactivity and could be less engaging for users who might want to interact with the Course data.

2. **Website**: This option stands out to me as it allows for user interaction and can be easily updated. It also provides a platform for future enhancements, such as adding more features related to Course management.

3. **Dashboard**: This is a strong option for visualizing data, but it may be more complex than necessary for the initial task of simply creating a Course entity. It could be more suitable if we plan to manage multiple entities or require real-time data visualization.

Given these considerations, I lean towards the **Website** modality as it balances user engagement and future scalability. What do you think? Do you agree with this direction, or do you have another preference?

I completely agree with your assessment of the modalities. The **Website** option indeed provides a great balance of interactivity and scalability, making it an ideal choice for presenting the Course entity. It allows users to easily input and manage Course data while also leaving room for future enhancements.

Since we both see the value in the Website modality for this task, I believe we can finalize our decision.

### Code Review

1. **Importing Classes**: 
   - The `Course` model and corresponding Pydantic schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is essential for the application to function correctly as per the user's requirements.

2. **Method Implementation**: 
   - The `Course` entity creation logic is missing. There should be methods to handle the creation of a course, similar to how students are handled.

3. **Comments**: 
   - While comments are present, they are missing for the new methods that need to be added for the `Course` entity.

4. **Potential Bugs**: 
   - Without the `Course` model and its handling, the application will not function as intended, leading to potential runtime errors.

5. **Conformance to User Tasks**: 
   - The current code does not fulfill the user's requirement to create a `Course` entity. This is a critical oversight.

6. **User Interaction**: 
   - The GUI does not provide any functionality to interact with the `Course` entity, which is a requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment

**Comment**: The implementation of the `Course` entity is missing, which is crucial to meet the user's requirements. You need to create a `Course` model, a corresponding Pydantic schema, and methods to handle course creation and interaction in the GUI.

### Suggested Revisions

1. **Create a Course Model** in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       '''
       Course model representing the courses table in the database.
       '''
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a Course Schema** in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for creating a new course.
       '''
       name: str
       level: str
       
   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for returning course data.
       '''
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str
       
       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Add Course Creation Logic** in `main.py`:
   - Extend the GUI to include fields for course creation and a method to handle the POST request for creating a course.

4. **Update Database Initialization** in `database.py`:
   - Ensure that the `Course` table is created during the database initialization.

5. **Create Migration Script** for the `Course` table:
   - Similar to the existing migration script, create a new migration script to add the `courses` table.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements and allow for proper interaction with both `Student` and `Course` entities.

### Conclusion
Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application meets the user's requirements effectively.

Comments on Codes:
"### Code Review

1. **Importing Classes**: 
   - The `Course` model and corresponding Pydantic schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is essential for the application to function correctly as per the user's requirements.

2. **Method Implementation**: 
   - The `Course` entity creation logic is missing. There should be methods to handle the creation of a course, similar to how students are handled.

3. **Comments**: 
   - While comments are present, they are missing for the new methods that need to be added for the `Course` entity.

4. **Potential Bugs**: 
   - Without the `Course` model and its handling, the application will not function as intended, leading to potential runtime errors.

5. **Conformance to User Tasks**: 
   - The current code does not fulfill the user's requirement to create a `Course` entity. This is a critical oversight.

6. **User Interaction**: 
   - The GUI does not provide any functionality to interact with the `Course` entity, which is a requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment

**Comment**: The implementation of the `Course` entity is missing, which is crucial to meet the user's requirements. You need to create a `Course` model, a corresponding Pydantic schema, and methods to handle course creation and interaction in the GUI.

### Suggested Revisions

1. **Create a Course Model** in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       '''
       Course model representing the courses table in the database.
       '''
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a Course Schema** in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for creating a new course.
       '''
       name: str
       level: str
       
   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for returning course data.
       '''
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str
       
       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Add Course Creation Logic** in `main.py`:
   - Extend the GUI to include fields for course creation and a method to handle the POST request for creating a course.

4. **Update Database Initialization** in `database.py`:
   - Ensure that the `Course` table is created during the database initialization.

5. **Create Migration Script** for the `Course` table:
   - Similar to the existing migration script, create a new migration script to add the `courses` table.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements and allow for proper interaction with both `Student` and `Course` entities.

### Conclusion
Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application meets the user's requirements effectively."

Importing Classes: \n   - The Course model and corresponding Pydantic schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is essential for the application to function correctly as per the user\'s requirements.\n\n2. Method Implementation: \n   - The Course entity creation logic is missing. There should be methods to handle the creation of a course, similar to how students are handled.\n\n3. Comments: \n   - While comments are present, they are missing for the new methods that need to be added for the Course entity.\n\n4. Potential Bugs: \n   - Without the Course model and its handling, the application will not function as intended, leading to potential runtime errors.\n\n5. Conformance to User Tasks: \n   - The current code does not fulfill the user\'s requirement to create a Course entity. This is a critical oversight.\n\n6. User Interaction: \n   - The GUI does not provide any functionality to interact with the Course entity, which is a requirement.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment\n\nComment: The implementation of the Course entity is missing, which is crucial to meet the user\'s requirements. You need to create a Course model, a corresponding Pydantic schema, and methods to handle course creation and interaction in the GUI.\n\n### Suggested Revisions\n\n1. Create a Course Model in models.py:\n   python\n   class Course(Base):\n       \'\'\'\n       Course model representing the courses table in the database.\n       \'\'\'\n       __tablename__ = "courses"\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Create a Course Schema in schemas.py:\n   python\n   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n       \'\'\'\n       Schema for creating a new course.\n       \'\'\'\n       name: str\n       level: str\n       \n   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):\n       \'\'\'\n       Schema for returning course data.\n       \'\'\'\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       level: str\n       \n       class Config:\n           orm_mode = True\n\n\n3. Add Course Creation Logic in main.py:\n   - Extend the GUI to include fields for course creation and a method to handle the POST request for creating a course.\n\n4. Update Database Initialization in database.py:\n   - Ensure that the Course table is created during the database initialization.\n\n5. Create Migration Script for the Course table:\n   - Similar to the existing migration script, create a new migration script to add the courses table.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the user\'s requirements and allow for proper interaction with both Student and Course entities.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlease proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application meets the user\'s requirements effectively.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing API Endpoint for Course Creation:**
The `main.py` file does not include an API endpoint for handling the POST request to create a new course. While the GUI allows users to input course data, there is no backend route defined in the FastAPI application to process this request.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Add a Course Creation Endpoint in the FastAPI Application:**
   You need to implement an endpoint in your FastAPI application (which is presumably in a separate file not shown here) to handle the creation of a course. Here’s an example of how you might implement it in your FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Course
from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse
from database import get_db

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
    db.add(db_course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_course)
    return db_course
```

2. **Ensure that the FastAPI application is running:**
   Make sure that your FastAPI application is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` so that the GUI can successfully send requests to it.

### Additional Suggestions:
- **Database Migration:** Ensure that you run the migration script to create the new `courses` table in your database.
- **Testing:** After implementing the above changes, test the application to ensure that both student and course creation functionalities work seamlessly.

By addressing the missing API endpoint, you will ensure that the software is operable and meets the user's requirements effectively. 

If you implement the above suggestions, the application should function as intended.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements for creating a Course entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure full compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Course API Endpoint Implementation**

The code does not include the FastAPI endpoint for creating a Course entity, which is essential for the `add_course` method in `main.py` to function correctly. Without this endpoint, the application will not be able to handle POST requests to add courses, leading to a failure in the user interaction for course creation.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Implement the Course API Endpoint**: In your FastAPI application (presumably in `main.py` or a separate routes file), you need to add an endpoint for creating a course. Here’s an example of how to implement it:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Course
from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse
from database import get_db

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Create a new course in the database.
    '''
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
    db.add(db_course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_course)
    return db_course
```

2. **Ensure Database Initialization**: Make sure that the `init_db()` function is called at the start of your application to create the necessary tables, including the new `courses` table.

### Additional Suggestions:
- **Testing**: After implementing the endpoint, test the application to ensure that both student and course creation functionalities work seamlessly.
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling for the database operations to manage potential issues when adding courses.

By implementing the above suggestions, the application will be fully operational, allowing users to interact with both the Student and Course entities without losing any required features.

If you implement these changes, the application should meet all the requirements specified by the customer.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries typically used in a Python web application with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Note: tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to specify in requirements
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to communicate with the FastAPI backend.
- **tkinter**: This is included with Python's standard library, so it does not need to be specified in the `requirements.txt`.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your specific needs or compatibility requirements.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries typically used in a Python web application with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Note: tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to specify in requirements
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to communicate with the FastAPI backend.
- **tkinter**: This is included with Python's standard library, so it does not need to be specified in the `requirements.txt`.
Make sure to adjust the versions according to your specific needs or compatibility requirements. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
