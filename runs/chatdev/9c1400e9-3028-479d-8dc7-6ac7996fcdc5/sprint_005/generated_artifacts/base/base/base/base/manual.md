# Student Registration Web Application

A simple web application for managing student registrations using FastAPI and SQLite.

## Main Functions

- **Add a Student**: Users can register a new student by providing their name.
- **Database Persistence**: All student data is stored in an SQLite database, which is created automatically on startup.
- **JSON Responses**: The API returns responses in JSON format, making it easy to integrate with other applications or services.

## Quick Install

To get started with the Student Registration Web Application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy
   ```

## How to Run the Application

1. **Start the FastAPI Server**:
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   This will start the FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Access the API Documentation**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`. This will take you to the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI, where you can test the API endpoints.

3. **Using the GUI**:
   To interact with the API through a graphical user interface, run the GUI application:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```
   This will open a window where you can enter a student's name and submit it.

## How to Use the Application

### Adding a Student

1. **Open the GUI**:
   After running `gui.py`, a window will appear.

2. **Enter Student Name**:
   In the text field labeled "Student Name:", type the name of the student you wish to register.

3. **Submit**:
   Click the "Submit" button. If the registration is successful, you will see a message indicating that the student has been added. If there is an error, an appropriate message will be displayed.

### API Endpoints

    {
      "name": "Student Name"
    }
    ```
