To address the customer's request for creating a Teacher entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. Given the straightforward nature of the task, we could opt for a few different modalities. 

1. **Document**: This could be useful if we want to provide a detailed specification or documentation of the Teacher entity, including its fields and requirements.

2. **Website**: A simple web page could effectively present the Teacher entity's details, allowing for easy access and interaction.

3. **Dashboard**: If we envision a more dynamic presentation, a dashboard could display the Teacher entity alongside other entities like Student and Course, providing a comprehensive view.

4. **Application**: If we want to create a more interactive experience, an application could allow users to input and manage Teacher data.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I believe each of these modalities has its merits, but considering the simplicity of the task and the need for clarity in presenting the Teacher entity, I would lean towards creating a **Document**. This would allow us to clearly outline the specifications, requirements, and any additional context needed for the Teacher entity without overwhelming the user with unnecessary complexity.

However, if we want to provide a more interactive experience, a **Website** could also be a strong contender, especially if we foresee the need for users to interact with the Teacher entity in the future.

What do you think? Should we prioritize clarity with a Document, or go for interactivity with a Website?

I appreciate your insights, and I agree that clarity is crucial, especially for a straightforward task like this. A **Document** would indeed provide a clear and concise way to present the specifications of the Teacher entity, making it easy for stakeholders to understand the requirements.

On the other hand, if we anticipate future interactions or modifications related to the Teacher entity, a **Website** could offer a more flexible platform for users to engage with the data. 

Ultimately, if we prioritize the immediate need for clarity and documentation, I would support the **Document** modality. However, if we want to future-proof our solution and allow for potential interactivity, the **Website** might be the better choice.

Given our discussion, I lean slightly towards the **Document** for its clarity. What do you think we should finalize on?

[2025-28-10 18:02:38 INFO] Code Reviewer: **Code Reviewer<->Programmer on : CodeReviewComment, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has several issues that need to be addressed to meet the requirements of creating a Teacher entity and ensuring the database migration preserves existing Student and Course data. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical oversight.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There is no method for creating a Teacher entity in the API routes, which is essential to fulfill the task.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for the Teacher entity will need comments as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code has a potential bug where the email field for the Student model is initially nullable, which contradicts the requirement of being required.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not currently conform to the task as it lacks the Teacher entity and related functionality.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The GUI does not provide any functionality for interacting with the Teacher entity.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the Teacher entity and its associated functionality, which is essential to meet the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Teacher Model**: Create a new `Teacher` model in `models.py` similar to the `Student` and `Course` models.

```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Email should be required
```

2. **Create a Teacher Schema**: Define a new schema for the Teacher entity in `schemas.py`.

```python
class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr  # Email field with validation

class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
```

3. **Implement Teacher API Routes**: Create a new router for handling Teacher operations in a new file `teacher_router.py`.

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import SessionLocal
from models import Teacher
from schemas import TeacherCreate, TeacherResponse

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/teachers", response_model=TeacherResponse, status_code=201)
def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate):
    db: Session = SessionLocal()
    db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
    db.add(db_teacher)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_teacher)
    db.close()
    return db_teacher
```

4. **Update the Main Application**: Include the new `teacher_router` in `main.py`.

```python
from teacher_router import router as teacher_router  # Importing the teacher router
app.include_router(teacher_router)
```

5. **Create Migration Script**: Add a migration script to create the `teachers` table and ensure it is included in the database migrations.

```python
def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True, index=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
```

6. **Update GUI**: Modify `gui.py` to include fields for Teacher registration.

```python
tk.Label(root, text="Teacher Name:").pack()
teacher_name_entry = tk.Entry(root)
teacher_name_entry.pack()
tk.Label(root, text="Teacher Email:").pack()
teacher_email_entry = tk.Entry(root)
teacher_email_entry.pack()
submit_teacher_button = tk.Button(root, text="Submit Teacher", command=submit_teacher)
submit_teacher_button.pack()
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirements set forth by the customer, allowing for the creation of Teacher entities while preserving existing Student and Course data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has several issues that need to be addressed to meet the requirements of creating a Teacher entity and ensuring the database migration preserves existing Student and Course data. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical oversight.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There is no method for creating a Teacher entity in the API routes, which is essential to fulfill the task.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for the Teacher entity will need comments as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code has a potential bug where the email field for the Student model is initially nullable, which contradicts the requirement of being required.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not currently conform to the task as it lacks the Teacher entity and related functionality.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The GUI does not provide any functionality for interacting with the Teacher entity.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the Teacher entity and its associated functionality, which is essential to meet the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Teacher Model**: Create a new `Teacher` model in `models.py` similar to the `Student` and `Course` models.

```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Email should be required
```

2. **Create a Teacher Schema**: Define a new schema for the Teacher entity in `schemas.py`.

```python
class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr  # Email field with validation

class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
```

3. **Implement Teacher API Routes**: Create a new router for handling Teacher operations in a new file `teacher_router.py`.

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import SessionLocal
from models import Teacher
from schemas import TeacherCreate, TeacherResponse

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/teachers", response_model=TeacherResponse, status_code=201)
def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate):
    db: Session = SessionLocal()
    db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
    db.add(db_teacher)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_teacher)
    db.close()
    return db_teacher
```

4. **Update the Main Application**: Include the new `teacher_router` in `main.py`.

```python
from teacher_router import router as teacher_router  # Importing the teacher router
app.include_router(teacher_router)
```

5. **Create Migration Script**: Add a migration script to create the `teachers` table and ensure it is included in the database migrations.

```python
def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True, index=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
```

6. **Update GUI**: Modify `gui.py` to include fields for Teacher registration.

```python
tk.Label(root, text="Teacher Name:").pack()
teacher_name_entry = tk.Entry(root)
teacher_name_entry.pack()
tk.Label(root, text="Teacher Email:").pack()
teacher_email_entry = tk.Entry(root)
teacher_email_entry.pack()
submit_teacher_button = tk.Button(root, text="Submit Teacher", command=submit_teacher)
submit_teacher_button.pack()
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirements set forth by the customer, allowing for the creation of Teacher entities while preserving existing Student and Course data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: The Teacher model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical oversight.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: There is no method for creating a Teacher entity in the API routes, which is essential to fulfill the task.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for the Teacher entity will need comments as well.\n\n4. No potential bugs: The existing code has a potential bug where the email field for the Student model is initially nullable, which contradicts the requirement of being required.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The project does not currently conform to the task as it lacks the Teacher entity and related functionality.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: The GUI does not provide any functionality for interacting with the Teacher entity.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the absence of the Teacher entity and its associated functionality, which is essential to meet the customer\'s requirements.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Define the Teacher Model: Create a new Teacher model in models.py similar to the Student and Course models.\n\npython\nclass Teacher(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'teachers\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Email should be required\n\n\n2. Create a Teacher Schema: Define a new schema for the Teacher entity in schemas.py.\n\npython\nclass TeacherCreate(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n    email: EmailStr  # Email field with validation\n\nclass TeacherResponse(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    email: str\n\n\n3. Implement Teacher API Routes: Create a new router for handling Teacher operations in a new file teacher_router.py.\n\npython\nfrom fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\nfrom database import SessionLocal\nfrom models import Teacher\nfrom schemas import TeacherCreate, TeacherResponse\n\nrouter = APIRouter()\n\n@router.post("/teachers", response_model=TeacherResponse, status_code=201)\ndef create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate):\n    db: Session = SessionLocal()\n    db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)\n    db.add(db_teacher)\n    db.commit()\n    db.refresh(db_teacher)\n    db.close()\n    return db_teacher\n\n\n4. Update the Main Application: Include the new teacher_router in main.py.\n\npython\nfrom teacher_router import router as teacher_router  # Importing the teacher router\napp.include_router(teacher_router)\n\n\n5. Create Migration Script: Add a migration script to create the teachers table and ensure it is included in the database migrations.\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    op.create_table(\n        \'teachers\',\n        sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer, primary_key=True, index=True),\n        sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column(\'email\', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n    )\n\n\n6. Update GUI: Modify gui.py to include fields for Teacher registration.\n\npython\ntk.Label(root, text="Teacher Name:").pack()\nteacher_name_entry = tk.Entry(root)\nteacher_name_entry.pack()\ntk.Label(root, text="Teacher Email:").pack()\nteacher_email_entry = tk.Entry(root)\nteacher_email_entry.pack()\nsubmit_teacher_button = tk.Button(root, text="Submit Teacher", command=submit_teacher)\nsubmit_teacher_button.pack()\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirements set forth by the customer, allowing for the creation of Teacher entities while preserving existing Student and Course data. \n\nPlease proceed with these revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer\'s needs.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements of creating a Teacher entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The database migration script for adding the Teacher table should be executed properly to ensure that the existing Student and Course data is preserved. Additionally, the migration script should have a proper revision identifier that reflects its purpose.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Migration Script Naming and Revision Identifier:**
   - Ensure that the migration script for adding the Teacher table has a clear and descriptive revision identifier. For example, change the revision identifier from `'add_teacher_table'` to something like `'add_teacher_table_with_email'` to reflect its purpose more clearly.

2. **Database Migration Execution:**
   - Ensure that the migration script is executed properly in the database. You may need to run the Alembic migration command to apply the migration to the database. This can be done using:
     ```bash
     alembic upgrade head
     ```

3. **Testing the API:**
   - After applying the migration, test the API endpoints for both Teacher and Student to ensure that they work as expected and that no data is lost during the migration process.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update any relevant documentation to reflect the addition of the Teacher entity and its API endpoints.

By addressing these points, you can ensure that the software is operable without further coding and meets all the requirements set by the user.

If you implement these suggestions, the code will be in compliance with the regulations.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly and meets the user's requirements.

**Comment with the Highest Priority:**
The `Teacher` entity is defined and the corresponding API route is implemented, but the database migration script for adding the `Teacher` table is not executed automatically when the application starts. This means that if the migration is not run manually, the `teachers` table will not be created, leading to potential errors when trying to add teachers through the API.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. Ensure that the migration script for creating the `teachers` table is executed during the application startup. You can do this by integrating Alembic's migration commands into the `startup` event of the FastAPI application.

2. Update the `main.py` file to include the migration logic. Here’s an example of how to do this:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import engine
from models import Base
from student_router import router as student_router
from course_router import router as course_router
from teacher_router import router as teacher_router
from alembic import command
from alembic.config import Config

# Create the FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    # Run migrations
    alembic_cfg = Config("alembic.ini")  # Ensure you have an alembic.ini file configured
    command.upgrade(alembic_cfg, "head")  # This will apply all migrations

    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# Include the student, course, and teacher routers
app.include_router(student_router)
app.include_router(course_router)
app.include_router(teacher_router)
```

3. Ensure that you have an `alembic.ini` file configured properly for your database connection.

By implementing these changes, the application will automatically apply the necessary migrations when it starts, ensuring that the `teachers` table is created and the application can function as intended.

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the software operates correctly without further coding.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly and meets the user's requirements.

**Comment with the Highest Priority:**
The `Teacher` entity is defined and the corresponding API route is implemented, but the database migration script for adding the `Teacher` table is not executed automatically when the application starts. This means that if the migration is not run manually, the `teachers` table will not be created, leading to potential errors when trying to add teachers through the API.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. Ensure that the migration script for creating the `teachers` table is executed during the application startup. You can do this by integrating Alembic's migration commands into the `startup` event of the FastAPI application.

2. Update the `main.py` file to include the migration logic. Here’s an example of how to do this:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import engine
from models import Base
from student_router import router as student_router
from course_router import router as course_router
from teacher_router import router as teacher_router
from alembic import command
from alembic.config import Config

# Create the FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    # Run migrations
    alembic_cfg = Config("alembic.ini")  # Ensure you have an alembic.ini file configured
    command.upgrade(alembic_cfg, "head")  # This will apply all migrations

    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# Include the student, course, and teacher routers
app.include_router(student_router)
app.include_router(course_router)
app.include_router(teacher_router)
```

3. Ensure that you have an `alembic.ini` file configured properly for your database connection.

By implementing these changes, the application will automatically apply the necessary migrations when it starts, ensuring that the `teachers` table is created and the application can function as intended.

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the software operates correctly without further coding."

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries commonly used in FastAPI applications, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Note: Tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to specify in requirements
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI for API calls.
- **tkinter**: The GUI toolkit used for the application interface (note that it is part of the Python standard library and typically does not need to be installed separately).

Make sure to adjust the versions as necessary based on your project requirements or compatibility needs.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
