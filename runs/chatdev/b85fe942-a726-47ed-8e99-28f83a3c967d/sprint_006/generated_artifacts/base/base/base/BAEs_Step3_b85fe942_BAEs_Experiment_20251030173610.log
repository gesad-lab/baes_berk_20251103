You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information. Given the requirements, we could utilize a few different modalities. 

1. **Database Schema Update**: This could be documented in a **Document** format, providing a clear outline of the changes made to the database schema.
  
2. **Dashboard**: If we want to visualize the Course data alongside existing Student data, a **Dashboard** could be beneficial for real-time insights.

3. **Website**: We could create a simple **Website** to present the Course information, allowing users to interact with the Course entity.

4. **Application**: If we want to provide a more interactive experience, an **Application** could allow users to manage Courses and view related data.

What are your thoughts on these modalities? Which one do you think would best satisfy the customer's needs?

I believe that a **Dashboard** would be the most effective modality for this task. It allows us to visualize the Course entity alongside existing Student data, providing a comprehensive view of both entities and their relationships. This would be particularly useful for users who need to manage and analyze the data effectively.

Additionally, a Dashboard can be designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and explore the Course data in real-time, which adds significant value.

What do you think? Should we proceed with the Dashboard as our chosen modality?

I completely agree with your assessment. A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a powerful and interactive way to visualize the Course entity alongside existing Student data. It allows for real-time analysis and management, which is essential for users who need to make informed decisions based on the data.

The interactivity and visual representation will enhance user experience and engagement, making it a suitable choice for this task. 

If we are both in agreement, we can finalize our decision. Shall we proceed with the Dashboard as our chosen modality?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity and ensuring the existing Student data is preserved, I will review the provided code against the regulations outlined.

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The necessary imports for the Course entity are missing. Specifically, the Course model and schema need to be created and imported where necessary.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The code does not include any methods for handling the Course entity, such as creating, retrieving, or updating courses.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Since there are no methods for the Course entity, there are no comments related to those methods.

4. **No potential bugs**: There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the lack of Course entity handling could lead to issues when trying to interact with courses.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not currently conform to the user's requirements as the Course entity has not been implemented.

6. **User interaction with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation only allows for student registration and does not include any functionality for courses.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the Course entity has not been created or integrated into the existing codebase. This is essential to meet the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course Model**: Add a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
    ```python
    class Course(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'courses'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
        name = Column(String, nullable=False)
        level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    ```

2. **Create a Course Schema**: Add a new schema for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
    ```python
    class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
        name: str
        level: str

    class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
        id: int
        name: str
        level: str

        class Config:
            orm_mode = True
    ```

3. **Update the Router**: Create a new router for the Course entity in `routers.py`:
    ```python
    from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
    from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
    from database import SessionLocal
    from models import Course
    from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

    router_course = APIRouter()

    @router_course.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
    def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
        db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
        db.add(db_course)
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(db_course)
        return db_course
    ```

4. **Include the Course Router**: Update `main.py` to include the new course router:
    ```python
    from routers import router, router_course  # Import the new router

    app.include_router(router_course)  # Include the course router
    ```

5. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new Course table without affecting existing Student data. The `init_db()` function will handle this if the models are correctly defined.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating a Course entity while preserving existing Student data.

### Final Note:
Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs.

            orm_mode = True
    ```

3. **Update the Router**: Create a new router for the Course entity in `routers.py`:
    ```python
    from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
    from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
    from database import SessionLocal
    from models import Course
    from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

    router_course = APIRouter()

    @router_course.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
    def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
        db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
        db.add(db_course)
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(db_course)
        return db_course
    ```

4. **Include the Course Router**: Update `main.py` to include the new course router:
    ```python
    from routers import router, router_course  # Import the new router

    app.include_router(router_course)  # Include the course router
    ```

5. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new Course table without affecting existing Student data. The `init_db()` function will handle this if the models are correctly defined.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating a Course entity while preserving existing Student data.

### Final Note:
Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs.

Comments on Codes:
"To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity and ensuring the existing Student data is preserved, I will review the provided code against the regulations outlined.

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The necessary imports for the Course entity are missing. Specifically, the Course model and schema need to be created and imported where necessary.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The code does not include any methods for handling the Course entity, such as creating, retrieving, or updating courses.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Since there are no methods for the Course entity, there are no comments related to those methods.

4. **No potential bugs**: There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the lack of Course entity handling could lead to issues when trying to interact with courses.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not currently conform to the user's requirements as the Course entity has not been implemented.

6. **User interaction with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation only allows for student registration and does not include any functionality for courses.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the Course entity has not been created or integrated into the existing codebase. This is essential to meet the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course Model**: Add a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
    ```python
    class Course(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'courses'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
        name = Column(String, nullable=False)
        level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    ```

2. **Create a Course Schema**: Add a new schema for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
    ```python
    class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
        name: str
        level: str

    class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
        id: int
        name: str
        level: str

        class Config:
            orm_mode = True
    ```

3. **Update the Router**: Create a new router for the Course entity in `routers.py`:
    ```python
    from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
    from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
    from database import SessionLocal
    from models import Course
    from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

    router_course = APIRouter()

    @router_course.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
    def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
        db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
        db.add(db_course)
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(db_course)
        return db_course
    ```

4. **Include the Course Router**: Update `main.py` to include the new course router:
    ```python
    from routers import router, router_course  # Import the new router

    app.include_router(router_course)  # Include the course router
    ```

5. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new Course table without affecting existing Student data. The `init_db()` function will handle this if the models are correctly defined.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating a Course entity while preserving existing Student data.

### Final Note:
Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Sure! Below are the modified codes for each file, incorporating the necessary changes to create the Course entity while preserving the existing Student data. Each file is formatted according to your specified markdown code block format.

This is essential to meet the customer\'s requirements.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Create a Course Model: Add a new model for the Course entity in models.py:\n    python\n    class Course(Base):\n        __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n        name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n        level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Create a Course Schema: Add a new schema for the Course entity in schemas.py:\n    python\n    class CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n        name: str\n        level: str\n\n    class CourseResponse(BaseModel):\n        id: int\n        name: str\n        level: str\n\n        class Config:\n            orm_mode = True\n\n\n3. Update the Router: Create a new router for the Course entity in routers.py:\n    python\n    from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends\n    from sqlalchemy.orm import Session\n    from database import SessionLocal\n    from models import Course\n    from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse\n\n    router_course = APIRouter()\n\n    @router_course.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)\n    def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n        db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)\n        db.add(db_course)\n        db.commit()\n        db.refresh(db_course)\n        return db_course\n\n\n4. Include the Course Router: Update main.py to include the new course router:\n    python\n    from routers import router, router_course  # Import the new router\n\n    app.include_router(router_course)  # Include the course router\n\n\n5. Database Migration: Ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new Course table without affecting existing Student data. The init_db() function will handle this if the models are correctly defined.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer\'s requirements for creating a Course entity while preserving existing Student data.\n\n### Final Note:\nPlease proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer\'s needs.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed:

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration for Existing Student Data:**
The current implementation does not explicitly handle database migrations, which is essential for preserving existing Student data when adding the new Course table. While the `init_db()` function creates the database schema, it does not account for migrations or updates to the schema without losing existing data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement a Migration Strategy:**
   - Use a migration tool like Alembic to manage database schema changes. This will allow you to create migration scripts that can be applied to the database without losing existing data.
   - Initialize Alembic in your project and create a migration script that adds the `courses` table while preserving the `students` table.

2. **Update the `init_db()` function:**
   - Modify the `init_db()` function to check if the `courses` table already exists before creating it. This can prevent errors if the function is called multiple times.

3. **Add Migration Scripts:**
   - Create a migration script that defines the changes to be made to the database schema, specifically for adding the `courses` table.

### Example of Migration Setup:
1. Install Alembic:
   ```bash
   pip install alembic
   ```

2. Initialize Alembic:
   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   ```

3. Create a migration script:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add courses table"
   ```

4. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database schema can be updated without losing existing data, thus fulfilling the customer's requirement.

### Conclusion:
Please implement the above suggestions to ensure the application meets the requirements and operates correctly without data loss during schema updates.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed:

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration for Existing Student Data:**
The current implementation does not explicitly handle database migrations, which is essential for preserving existing Student data when adding the new Course table. While the `init_db()` function creates the database schema, it does not account for migrations or updates to the schema without losing existing data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement a Migration Strategy:**
   - Use a migration tool like Alembic to manage database schema changes. This will allow you to create migration scripts that can be applied to the database without losing existing data.
   - Initialize Alembic in your project and create a migration script that adds the `courses` table while preserving the `students` table.

2. **Update the `init_db()` function:**
   - Modify the `init_db()` function to check if the `courses` table already exists before creating it. This can prevent errors if the function is called multiple times.

3. **Add Migration Scripts:**
   - Create a migration script that defines the changes to be made to the database schema, specifically for adding the `courses` table.

### Example of Migration Setup:
1. Install Alembic:
   ```bash
   pip install alembic
   ```

2. Initialize Alembic:
   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   ```

3. Create a migration script:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add courses table"
   ```

4. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database schema can be updated without losing existing data, thus fulfilling the customer's requirement.

### Conclusion:
Please implement the above suggestions to ensure the application meets the requirements and operates correctly without data loss during schema updates.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary changes to implement a migration strategy using Alembic, ensuring that existing Student data is preserved while adding the new Course table.

While the init_db() function creates the database schema, it does not account for migrations or updates to the schema without losing existing data.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Implement a Migration Strategy:\n   - Use a migration tool like Alembic to manage database schema changes. This will allow you to create migration scripts that can be applied to the database without losing existing data.\n   - Initialize Alembic in your project and create a migration script that adds the courses table while preserving the students table.\n\n2. Update the init_db() function:\n   - Modify the init_db() function to check if the courses table already exists before creating it. This can prevent errors if the function is called multiple times.\n\n3. Add Migration Scripts:\n   - Create a migration script that defines the changes to be made to the database schema, specifically for adding the courses table.\n\n### Example of Migration Setup:\n1. Install Alembic:\n   bash\n   pip install alembic\n\n\n2. Initialize Alembic:\n   bash\n   alembic init alembic\n\n\n3. Create a migration script:\n   bash\n   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add courses table"\n\n\n4. Apply the migration:\n   bash\n   alembic upgrade head\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database schema can be updated without losing existing data, thus fulfilling the customer\'s requirement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlease implement the above suggestions to ensure the application meets the requirements and operates correctly without data loss during schema updates.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!'} |

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here is my detailed analysis:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The imports in `routers.py`, `gui.py`, `schemas.py`, `models.py`, and `main.py` are correct and include all necessary classes.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods in the provided code are implemented correctly.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - While most methods have comments, the `create_course` method in `routers.py` lacks a detailed comment explaining its functionality. It should include a brief description of what the method does.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, the `submit_course` method in `gui.py` does not handle the response properly if the course creation fails. It would be beneficial to log the error message for debugging purposes.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project meets the requirements of creating a Course entity and updating the database schema accordingly.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI allows for user interaction for both student and course registration, and it appears to function as intended.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the lack of error handling in the `submit_course` method in `gui.py`. If the course creation fails, the user is not informed of the specific reason for the failure, which could lead to confusion.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. Update the `submit_course` method in `gui.py` to include error logging and display the error message to the user if the course registration fails. Here’s how you can modify the method:

```python
def submit_course(self):
    course_name = self.entry_course_name.get()
    course_level = self.entry_course_level.get()
    if course_name and course_level:
        response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/", json={"name": course_name, "level": course_level})
        if response.status_code == 201:
            messagebox.showinfo("Success", "Course registered successfully!")
        else:
            # Log the error message for debugging
            error_message = response.json().get("detail", "Failed to register course.")
            messagebox.showerror("Error", f"Failed to register course: {error_message}")
    else:
        messagebox.showwarning("Warning", "Course name and level cannot be empty.")
```

This change will ensure that the user receives more informative feedback in case of an error during course registration.

### Conclusion:
With this adjustment, the code will provide better user experience and error handling, aligning with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
alembic==1.10.3
requests==2.28.1
pydantic==1.10.7
tkinter  # Note: tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to install separately
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to create the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python.
- **alembic**: The database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
- **requests**: The library used for making HTTP requests (used in the GUI for API calls).
- **pydantic**: The data validation and settings management library used for defining schemas.

### Note:
- `tkinter` is part of the Python standard library and does not need to be installed separately, so it is not included in the `requirements.txt`. However, if you are deploying on a system where it might not be available, you may want to document that it is required.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:
```plaintext

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:

  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
