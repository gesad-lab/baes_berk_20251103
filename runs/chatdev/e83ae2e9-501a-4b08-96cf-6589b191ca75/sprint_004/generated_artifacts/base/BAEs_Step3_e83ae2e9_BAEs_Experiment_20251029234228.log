To effectively address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we need to consider how the information will be presented and utilized. Given the nature of the Course entity, which includes fields for name and level, I believe a structured format would be beneficial. 

A database schema update is required, which suggests that a more technical representation might be necessary. However, we should also consider how the end-users will interact with this data. 

I propose we discuss whether a Document or a Dashboard would be more suitable. A Document could provide a detailed overview of the Course entity, while a Dashboard could allow for real-time interaction and visualization of multiple courses. 

What are your thoughts on this?

I appreciate your insights on the potential modalities. A Document would indeed provide a structured overview, which could be useful for documentation purposes. However, I lean towards the Dashboard option, as it would allow users to visualize and interact with multiple Course entities in real-time, making it more dynamic and user-friendly.

Additionally, a Dashboard could facilitate better decision-making by presenting data in a more accessible format, allowing users to filter and analyze courses based on different criteria.

What do you think about prioritizing the Dashboard for this task?

I see the value in prioritizing the Dashboard option. It aligns well with the need for interactivity and real-time data visualization, which can enhance user engagement and decision-making. The ability to filter and analyze courses dynamically would certainly provide a more robust experience for users.

Moreover, a Dashboard can be designed to accommodate future expansions, such as adding more fields or functionalities related to the Course entity. This flexibility could be beneficial as we continue to develop our offerings.

Given these points, I agree that the Dashboard is a strong choice for this task. Shall we finalize our decision on this modality?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, I will review the provided code in detail according to the regulations outlined.

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model is not defined or imported in any of the files. This is a critical oversight as the Course entity needs to be created.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There are no methods related to the Course entity in the provided code. We need to implement methods to create, retrieve, and manage Course entities.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Since there are no methods related to the Course entity, there are no comments to review. However, any new methods should include comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code for the Student entity appears to be functional, but without the Course entity, we cannot assess the overall functionality.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The current project does not conform to the user's request as it lacks the Course entity and related functionality.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The user cannot interact with the Course entity as it is not implemented.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The highest priority issue is the absence of the Course entity and its related functionality in the codebase. This is essential to meet the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course Model**: In `models.py`, define the Course model with the required fields.
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Implement Course Routes**: In `routes.py`, add routes to create and retrieve courses.
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseCreate)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseCreate])
   def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return courses
   ```

3. **Update Migration Script**: Create a new migration script to add the Course table to the database.
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'courses',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
   ```

4. **Update the GUI**: Modify `gui.py` to include functionality for adding and viewing courses.

By implementing these changes, the project will meet the customer's requirements and allow for proper interaction with the Course entity.

### Final Note:
Please proceed with the suggested changes to ensure the software meets the customer's needs.

   - The user cannot interact with the Course entity as it is not implemented.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The highest priority issue is the absence of the Course entity and its related functionality in the codebase. This is essential to meet the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course Model**: In `models.py`, define the Course model with the required fields.
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Implement Course Routes**: In `routes.py`, add routes to create and retrieve courses.
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseCreate)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseCreate])
   def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return courses
   ```

3. **Update Migration Script**: Create a new migration script to add the Course table to the database.
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'courses',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
   ```

4. **Update the GUI**: Modify `gui.py` to include functionality for adding and viewing courses.

By implementing these changes, the project will meet the customer's requirements and allow for proper interaction with the Course entity.

### Final Note:
Please proceed with the suggested changes to ensure the software meets the customer's needs.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's request for creating a Course entity with the specified fields and ensuring that the database migration preserves existing Student data, I will modify the existing codebase accordingly. Below are the updated codes for each file, formatted as requested.

 To fulfill the customer's request for creating a Course entity with the specified fields and ensuring that the database migration preserves existing Student data, I will modify the existing codebase accordingly. Below are the updated codes for each file, formatted as requested.

### models.py

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed analysis based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model is imported correctly in `routes.py`, and all necessary imports are present in other files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods in `routes.py`, `main.py`, and other files are implemented as required.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - While most methods have comments, the `create_course` method in `routes.py` could benefit from a more detailed comment explaining its purpose and functionality.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, it is essential to ensure that the database connection is handled correctly, especially in a multi-threaded environment.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project meets the requirements of creating a `Course` entity and updating the database schema.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI allows users to view courses, which is a necessary feature. However, there is no functionality to add a new course through the GUI, which may limit user interaction.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the GUI does not provide a way for users to add new courses. This is a significant oversight as it limits the functionality of the application regarding course management.

### Suggestions for Revision:
To enhance the functionality of the application, I recommend implementing a method in `gui.py` that allows users to add new courses. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Add Input Fields for Course Creation**: 
   - Add entry fields for `name` and `level` in the `StudentApp` class.

2. **Implement the `add_course` Method**: 
   - Create a method that sends a POST request to the `/courses/` endpoint to add a new course.

3. **Update the GUI Layout**: 
   - Ensure that the new fields and buttons are appropriately placed in the GUI.

Here’s a sample implementation for the `add_course` method and the corresponding GUI elements:

```python
# In gui.py, within the StudentApp class
self.course_name_label = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Course Name:")
self.course_name_label.pack()
self.course_name_entry = tk.Entry(master)
self.course_name_entry.pack()
self.course_level_label = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Course Level:")
self.course_level_label.pack()
self.course_level_entry = tk.Entry(master)
self.course_level_entry.pack()
self.add_course_button = tk.Button(master, text="Add Course", command=self.add_course)
self.add_course_button.pack()

def add_course(self):
    name = self.course_name_entry.get()
    level = self.course_level_entry.get()
    if name and level:
        response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/", json={"name": name, "level": level})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            messagebox.showinfo("Success", "Course added successfully!")
            self.course_name_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
            self.course_level_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        else:
            messagebox.showerror("Error", response.json().get("detail", "Failed to add course."))
    else:
        messagebox.showwarning("Input Error", "Please enter both course name and level.")
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing the above changes, you will enhance the user experience and ensure that the application meets all requirements set forth by the customer. 

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed analysis based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model is imported correctly in `routes.py`, and all necessary imports are present in other files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods in `routes.py`, `main.py`, and other files are implemented as required.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - While most methods have comments, the `create_course` method in `routes.py` could benefit from a more detailed comment explaining its purpose and functionality.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, it is essential to ensure that the database connection is handled correctly, especially in a multi-threaded environment.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project meets the requirements of creating a `Course` entity and updating the database schema.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI allows users to view courses, which is a necessary feature. However, there is no functionality to add a new course through the GUI, which may limit user interaction.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the GUI does not provide a way for users to add new courses. This is a significant oversight as it limits the functionality of the application regarding course management.

### Suggestions for Revision:
To enhance the functionality of the application, I recommend implementing a method in `gui.py` that allows users to add new courses. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Add Input Fields for Course Creation**: 
   - Add entry fields for `name` and `level` in the `StudentApp` class.

2. **Implement the `add_course` Method**: 
   - Create a method that sends a POST request to the `/courses/` endpoint to add a new course.

3. **Update the GUI Layout**: 
   - Ensure that the new fields and buttons are appropriately placed in the GUI.

Here’s a sample implementation for the `add_course` method and the corresponding GUI elements:

```python
# In gui.py, within the StudentApp class
self.course_name_label = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Course Name:")
self.course_name_label.pack()
self.course_name_entry = tk.Entry(master)
self.course_name_entry.pack()
self.course_level_label = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Course Level:")
self.course_level_label.pack()
self.course_level_entry = tk.Entry(master)
self.course_level_entry.pack()
self.add_course_button = tk.Button(master, text="Add Course", command=self.add_course)
self.add_course_button.pack()

def add_course(self):
    name = self.course_name_entry.get()
    level = self.course_level_entry.get()
    if name and level:
        response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/", json={"name": name, "level": level})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            messagebox.showinfo("Success", "Course added successfully!")
            self.course_name_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
            self.course_level_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
        else:
            messagebox.showerror("Error", response.json().get("detail", "Failed to add course."))
    else:
        messagebox.showwarning("Input Error", "Please enter both course name and level.")
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing the above changes, you will enhance the user experience and ensure that the application meets all requirements set forth by the customer. 

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here’s a detailed analysis based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - The Course model is imported correctly in routes.py, and all necessary imports are present in other files.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - All methods in routes.py, main.py, and other files are implemented as required.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - While most methods have comments, the create_course method in routes.py could benefit from a more detailed comment explaining its purpose and functionality.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, it is essential to ensure that the database connection is handled correctly, especially in a multi-threaded environment.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The project meets the requirements of creating a Course entity and updating the database schema.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - The GUI allows users to view courses, which is a necessary feature. However, there is no functionality to add a new course through the GUI, which may limit user interaction.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is that the GUI does not provide a way for users to add new courses. This is a significant oversight as it limits the functionality of the application regarding course management.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\nTo enhance the functionality of the application, I recommend implementing a method in gui.py that allows users to add new courses. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. Add Input Fields for Course Creation: \n   - Add entry fields for name and level in the StudentApp class.\n\n2. Implement the add_course Method: \n   - Create a method that sends a POST request to the /courses/ endpoint to add a new course.\n\n3. Update the GUI Layout: \n   - Ensure that the new fields and buttons are appropriately placed in the GUI.\n\nHere’s a sample implementation for the add_course method and the corresponding GUI elements:\n\npython\n# In gui.py, within the StudentApp class\nself.course_name_label = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Course Name:")\nself.course_name_label.pack()\nself.course_name_entry = tk.Entry(master)\nself.course_name_entry.pack()\nself.course_level_label = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Course Level:")\nself.course_level_label.pack()\nself.course_level_entry = tk.Entry(master)\nself.course_level_entry.pack()\nself.add_course_button = tk.Button(master, text="Add Course", command=self.add_course)\nself.add_course_button.pack()\n\ndef add_course(self):\n    name = self.course_name_entry.get()\n    level = self.course_level_entry.get()\n    if name and level:\n        response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/", json={"name": name, "level": level})\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            messagebox.showinfo("Success", "Course added successfully!")\n            self.course_name_entry.delete(0, tk.END)\n            self.course_level_entry.delete(0, tk.END)\n        else:\n            messagebox.showerror("Error", response.json().get("detail", "Failed to add course."))\n    else:\n        messagebox.showwarning("Input Error", "Please enter both course name and level.")\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy implementing the above changes, you will enhance the user experience and ensure that the application meets all requirements set forth by the customer. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask!'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Import Statements in `routes.py`:** The `Course` model is referenced in the `routes.py` file but is not explicitly imported. This will lead to a `NameError` when trying to create a new course.

### Suggested Revision:
To fix this issue, you need to add the import statement for the `Course` model at the beginning of the `routes.py` file. Here’s the revised import section:

```python
from models import Course  # Ensure this line is present
```

### Additional Suggestions:
1. **Database Migration:** Ensure that the migration script is executed properly to create the `courses` table without affecting existing `students` data. This should be tested after running the migration.
2. **Error Handling:** Consider adding more robust error handling in the API routes to manage exceptions that may arise during database operations.
3. **Validation:** Although the `BaseModel` from Pydantic handles basic validation, you might want to add more specific validation rules for the `level` field if there are predefined levels.

### Final Instructions:
1. Add the missing import statement in `routes.py`.
2. Test the application to ensure that the Course entity can be created and retrieved without issues.
3. Run the migration script to ensure the database schema is updated correctly.

By addressing the import issue, the application should function as intended without any immediate errors. 

If you implement these changes, the code should be operable as per the user's requirements.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your project, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your Python application:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
alembic==1.10.2
requests==2.28.1
tkinter==0.1.0  # Note: Tkinter is included with Python installations, so this line is optional.
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to create the API for managing courses and students.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used for database interactions.
- **alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy, used to manage schema changes.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to communicate with the FastAPI backend.
- **tkinter**: The GUI toolkit used for creating the application interface. Note that Tkinter is typically included with standard Python installations, so it may not be necessary to include it in the requirements.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers as needed based on your specific project requirements or compatibility.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Student Management System

A comprehensive application for managing students and courses, allowing users to add, view, and manage student and course data.

## Main Functions

- **Add Student**: Allows users to input student details (name and email) and save them to the database.
- **View Students**: Displays a list of all students currently stored in the database.
- **Add Course**: Enables users to create new courses by specifying the course name and level.
- **View Courses**: Shows a list of all courses available in the database.

## Installation Guide

To run the Student Management System, you need to set up your environment with the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-management-system.git
   cd student-management-system
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   You can install the required dependencies using pip. Make sure you have `pip` installed.
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi sqlalchemy alembic requests
   ```

4. **Install Tkinter**:
   Tkinter is required for the GUI. It usually comes pre-installed with Python, but if not, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```

5. **Run Database Migration**:
   Before starting the application, you need to run the migration script to create the necessary database tables.
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Start the Application**:
   Run the main application file to start the GUI.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Adding Students**:
   - Enter the student's name in the "Enter Student Name" field.
   - Enter the student's email in the "Enter Student Email" field.
   - Click the "Add Student" button to save the student to the database.
