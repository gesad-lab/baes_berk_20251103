To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be a **Dashboard**, which would allow us to visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time. This could include metrics such as the number of courses each student is enrolled in, course completion rates, and other relevant statistics.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Document** format, which would provide a detailed report on the relationship, including the schema changes and migration strategy. This would be useful for documentation purposes but may not provide the interactive experience that a dashboard would.

Another possibility is to create a **Website** that outlines the new relationship and provides a user-friendly interface for students to view and manage their courses. This could be an engaging way to present the information.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the different modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic and interactive way to visualize the relationships and metrics associated with students and their courses, which could be very beneficial for both administrators and students. 

On the other hand, a **Document** would serve as a comprehensive reference for the technical aspects of the implementation, ensuring that all stakeholders understand the changes made to the database schema and migration process.

The **Website** option could also be compelling, as it would allow for a more engaging user experience, enabling students to interact with their course information directly.

Considering the need for both visualization and documentation, I believe a **Dashboard** might be the most effective choice to meet the customer's needs while also providing a clear overview of the relationships. 

What do you think? Should we lean towards the Dashboard, or do you have a preference for another modality?

I agree that the **Dashboard** is a strong choice for this task. It not only allows for real-time visualization of the relationships between students and courses but also provides an interactive platform for users to engage with their data. This can enhance user experience and facilitate better decision-making for both students and administrators.

While the Document and Website options have their merits, the Dashboard's ability to present dynamic data and metrics in a visually appealing way aligns well with the customer's needs for understanding the course relationships.

I believe we should proceed with the **Dashboard** as our product modality. 

Are we in agreement on this?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided does not currently implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, which is a critical part of the task. Specifically, we need to establish a many-to-many relationship where a student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `Student` and `Course` models need to be updated to establish a many-to-many relationship, and the corresponding database migration script must be created to preserve existing data while adding this relationship.**

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Update the Models:**
   - Create an association table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

```python
# models.py
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey

# Association table for many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)  # Ensure email is unique
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update the Migration Script:**
   - Modify the migration script to create the association table.

```python
# migration_script.py
def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Create the association table for students and courses
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
```

3. **Update the FastAPI Endpoints:**
   - Implement endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve courses for a student.

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}

@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return student.courses
```

### Summary:
By implementing these changes, you will fulfill the requirement of establishing a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, allowing students to enroll in courses while preserving existing data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the application meets the customer's needs effectively.

[2025-30-10 10:50:50 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided does not currently implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, which is a critical part of the task. Specifically, we need to establish a many-to-many relationship where a student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `Student` and `Course` models need to be updated to establish a many-to-many relationship, and the corresponding database migration script must be created to preserve existing data while adding this relationship.**

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Update the Models:**
   - Create an association table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

```python
# models.py
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey

# Association table for many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)  # Ensure email is unique
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update the Migration Script:**
   - Modify the migration script to create the association table.

```python
# migration_script.py
def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Create the association table for students and courses
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
```

3. **Update the FastAPI Endpoints:**
   - Implement endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve courses for a student.

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}

@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return student.courses
```

### Summary:
By implementing these changes, you will fulfill the requirement of establishing a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, allowing students to enroll in courses while preserving existing data.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided does not currently implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, which is a critical part of the task. Specifically, we need to establish a many-to-many relationship where a student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `Student` and `Course` models need to be updated to establish a many-to-many relationship, and the corresponding database migration script must be created to preserve existing data while adding this relationship.**

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Update the Models:**
   - Create an association table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

```python
# models.py
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey

# Association table for many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)  # Ensure email is unique
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update the Migration Script:**
   - Modify the migration script to create the association table.

```python
# migration_script.py
def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Create the association table for students and courses
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
```

3. **Update the FastAPI Endpoints:**
   - Implement endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve courses for a student.

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}

@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return student.courses
```

### Summary:
By implementing these changes, you will fulfill the requirement of establishing a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, allowing students to enroll in courses while preserving existing data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the application meets the customer's needs effectively."

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary updates to establish a many-to-many relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, along with the required database migration and FastAPI endpoints.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements of the task. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure that the software operates correctly and meets the user's needs.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `enroll_student_in_course` method in `main.py` does not handle the case where a student is already enrolled in a course. This could lead to duplicate entries in the `student_courses` association table, which is not desirable.

### Suggested Revision:
To fix this issue, you should add a check in the `enroll_student_in_course` method to see if the student is already enrolled in the specified course before appending it to the `courses` list. If the student is already enrolled, return a message indicating that the enrollment already exists.

### Revised `enroll_student_in_course` Method:
```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    
    # Check if the student is already enrolled in the course
    if course in student.courses:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Student is already enrolled in this course")
    
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}
```

### Additional Suggestions:
1. **Documentation:** Ensure that all methods have clear docstrings explaining their purpose and parameters.
2. **Error Handling:** Consider adding more specific error handling for database operations to improve user feedback.
3. **Testing:** Implement unit tests to verify the functionality of the enrollment logic and other critical paths in the application.

By making these adjustments, the application will be more robust and user-friendly. 

If you implement these changes, the application should meet all the requirements effectively.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly according to the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `enroll_student_in_course` function in `main.py` does not handle the case where a student is already enrolled in a course. This could lead to duplicate entries in the `student_courses` association table, which violates the integrity of the data model.

### Suggested Revision:
You should check if the student is already enrolled in the course before appending the course to the student's `courses` relationship. If the student is already enrolled, return a relevant message instead of adding the course again.

Here is the revised `enroll_student_in_course` function:

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    
    # Check if the student is already enrolled in the course
    if course in student.courses:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Student is already enrolled in this course")
    
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}
```

### Instructions on Fix:
1. Update the `enroll_student_in_course` function in `main.py` as shown above.
2. Test the enrollment functionality to ensure that it correctly handles cases where a student is already enrolled in a course.

By implementing this change, you will enhance the robustness of the application and ensure that it adheres to the requirements specified by the user.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

'', 'comments': 'Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly according to the user\'s requirements.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe enroll_student_in_course function in main.py does not handle the case where a student is already enrolled in a course. This could lead to duplicate entries in the student_courses association table, which violates the integrity of the data model.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\nYou should check if the student is already enrolled in the course before appending the course to the student\'s courses relationship. If the student is already enrolled, return a relevant message instead of adding the course again.\n\nHere is the revised enroll_student_in_course function:\n\npython\n@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")\ndef enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()\n    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n    if not student or not course:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")\n    \n    # Check if the student is already enrolled in the course\n    if course in student.courses:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Student is already enrolled in this course")\n    \n    student.courses.append(course)\n    db.commit()\n    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}\n\n\n### Instructions on Fix:\n1. Update the enroll_student_in_course function in main.py as shown above.\n2. Test the enrollment functionality to ensure that it correctly handles cases where a student is already enrolled in a course.\n\nBy implementing this change, you will enhance the robustness of the application and ensure that it adheres to the requirements specified by the user.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly according to the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `enroll_student_in_course` function in `main.py` does not handle the case where a student is already enrolled in a course. This could lead to duplicate entries in the `student_courses` association table, which violates the integrity of the data model.

### Suggested Revision:
You should check if the student is already enrolled in the course before appending the course to the student's `courses` relationship. If the student is already enrolled, return a relevant message instead of adding the course again.

Here is the revised `enroll_student_in_course` function:

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    
    # Check if the student is already enrolled in the course
    if course in student.courses:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Student is already enrolled in this course")
    
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}
```

### Instructions on Fix:
1. Update the `enroll_student_in_course` function in `main.py` as shown above.
2. Test the enrollment functionality to ensure that it correctly handles cases where a student is already enrolled in a course.

By implementing this change, you will enhance the robustness of the application and ensure that it adheres to the requirements specified by the user.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

# Student and Course Management System

A simple GUI application for managing students and courses, allowing users to create students and courses, list them, and enroll students in courses.

## Main Functions

- **Create Student**: Add a new student by providing their name and email.
- **List Students**: Retrieve and display a list of all registered students.
- **Create Course**: Add a new course by providing its name and level.
- **List Courses**: Retrieve and display a list of all available courses.
- **Enroll Student in Course**: Enroll a student in a specific course using their IDs.
- **Get Student Courses**: Retrieve and display all courses a specific student is enrolled in.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to install the required dependencies. Follow the steps below:

1. **Set up a Python environment**: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using `venv`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**: Use `pip` to install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy alembic requests tkinter
   ```

3. **Set up the database**: The application uses SQLite for the database. The database will be created automatically when you run the application for the first time.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the FastAPI server**: Start the FastAPI application by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Launch the GUI**: Open another terminal and run the GUI application:

   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

3. **Using the GUI**:
   - **Creating a Student**:
     - Enter the student's name and email in the respective fields.
     - Click on "Create Student" to add the student.
   - **Listing Students**:
     - Click on "List Students" to display all registered students in the list box.
   - **Creating a Course**:
     - Enter the course name and level in the respective fields.
     - Click on "Create Course" to add the course.
   - **Listing Courses**:
     - Click on "List Courses" to display all available courses in the list box.
   - **Enrolling a Student in a Course**:
     - Enter the student ID and course ID in the respective fields.
     - Click on "Enroll Student in Course" to enroll the student.
   - **Getting Student Courses**:
     - You can extend the functionality to retrieve courses for a specific student by implementing a new button and corresponding function.

## Additional Information

- **Database Migration**: The application includes a migration script (`migration_script.py`) that creates the necessary tables and relationships in the database. You can run this script using Alembic to ensure your database schema is up to date.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling to inform users of any issues during student or course creation and enrollment.

For further assistance, please refer to the code comments or reach out to the development team.
