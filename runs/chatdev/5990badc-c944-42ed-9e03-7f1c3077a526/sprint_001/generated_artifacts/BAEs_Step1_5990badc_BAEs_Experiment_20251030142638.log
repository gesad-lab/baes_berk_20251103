To address the customer's request for a simple web application for a Student entity, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a Website. This modality allows us to create an interactive interface for users to interact with the Student entity and fulfill the requirements effectively. 

What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that a Website is a suitable product modality for this task. It allows for easy interaction with the API and provides a user-friendly interface for managing the Student entity. Additionally, it aligns well with the requirements of returning JSON responses and utilizing FastAPI. 

Let's proceed with this direction. Any other opinions?

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure the application into multiple files. The core classes and functions will be designed to handle the API endpoints, database interactions, and the GUI.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and sets up the routes.
   - `create_app()`: Initializes the FastAPI application and sets up the routes.
   - `create_database()`: Creates the SQLite database and the Student table if it doesn't exist.

2. **models.py**: Defines the database model for the Student entity.
   - `Student`: A SQLAlchemy model representing the Student entity with a name field.

3. **database.py**: Handles the database connection and session management.
   - `get_db()`: Provides a database session for each request.

4. **schemas.py**: Defines the Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.
   - `StudentCreate`: Schema for creating a new student.
   - `StudentResponse`: Schema for returning student data.

5. **gui.py**: Implements a simple GUI using Tkinter to interact with the FastAPI backend.
   - `StudentApp`: The main application class for the GUI.
   - `add_student()`: Function to add a student via the GUI.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly as per the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing FastAPI Application and API Endpoints Implementation:**
The provided code does not include the main FastAPI application setup or the API endpoints required to handle the creation of Student entities. Without this, the application will not be operable as intended.

### Suggested Revision:
You need to create a `main.py` file that initializes the FastAPI application, includes the necessary API endpoints for creating and retrieving students, and calls the `create_database()` function to ensure the database schema is created on startup. Here’s how you can implement it:

```python
# main.py
'''
Main application file for the Student API.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import create_database, get_db
from models import Student
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    create_database()

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/{student_id}", response_model=StudentResponse)
def read_student(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if student is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return student
```

### Instructions:
1. **Add the above code to your `main.py` file.** This will set up the FastAPI application and define the necessary endpoints for adding and retrieving students.
2. **Ensure that you have FastAPI and the required dependencies installed.** You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy
   ```
3. **Run the FastAPI application** using the command:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
4. **Test the API** using the GUI or tools like Postman or curl to ensure that the application behaves as expected.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet all the requirements specified by the user and will be operable without further coding.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the functionality of the application. Here is my highest priority comment and corresponding suggestions for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing FastAPI Application and API Endpoints Implementation**

The provided code does not include the FastAPI application setup and the necessary API endpoints to handle requests for creating and retrieving students. This is critical for the application to function as intended.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a FastAPI application in `main.py`:**
   - Import FastAPI and the necessary dependencies.
   - Initialize the FastAPI application.
   - Define the API endpoints for creating and retrieving students.

2. **Implement the API endpoints:**
   - Create a POST endpoint to add a new student.
   - Create a GET endpoint to retrieve all students.

Here is an example of how to implement these changes in `main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import create_database, get_db
from models import Student
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    create_database()

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the FastAPI server is running before testing the GUI application.
- The GUI application (`gui.py`) should remain unchanged, as it correctly interacts with the FastAPI endpoints.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet all the requirements specified by the customer and function correctly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Sure! Below are the modified codes for the web application, structured according to best practices and formatted as requested.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application functions as intended. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The FastAPI application is missing the main application file (`main.py`) that initializes the FastAPI app, defines the API endpoints, and integrates the database functionality. Without this, the application cannot handle requests or serve the API.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create the FastAPI application in `main.py`:**
   - Import necessary modules and classes.
   - Initialize the FastAPI app.
   - Define the API endpoint for creating a student.
   - Ensure the database is created on startup.

Here’s how you can implement the `main.py` file:

```python
'''
Main application file for the Student application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import create_database, get_db
from models import Student
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    create_database()

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/{student_id}", response_model=StudentResponse)
def read_student(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if student is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return student
```

### Instructions:
1. Create the `main.py` file as shown above.
2. Ensure that the FastAPI server is running by executing `uvicorn main:app --reload` from the terminal.
3. Test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or directly from the GUI.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable, and users will be able to interact with the Student entity as required.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found. This usually happens when the Python installation does not include the Tkinter library, which is required for creating GUI applications. To resolve this issue, we can provide instructions for the user to install Tkinter or use a different method to run the application.

However, since the task is to modify the code based on the error summary, we will include a check to ensure that the application can run without crashing if `tkinter` is not available. Below is the modified code for `main.py` that includes error handling for the `tkinter` import.

FILENAME
```python
'''
Graphical User Interface for the Student application.
'''
try:
    import tkinter as tk
    import requests
except ImportError:
    print("Tkinter is not available. Please install Tkinter to run the GUI.")
    exit()

class StudentApp:
    def __init__(self, master):
        self.master = master
        master.title("Student Application")
        self.label = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Student Name:")
        self.label.pack()
        self.entry = tk.Entry(master)
        self.entry.pack()
        self.add_button = tk.Button(master, text="Add Student", command=self.add_student)
        self.add_button.pack()
        self.result_label = tk.Label(master, text="")
        self.result_label.pack()

    def add_student(self):
        name = self.entry.get()
        response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.result_label.config(text="Student added successfully!")
        else:
            self.result_label.config(text="Error adding student.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = StudentApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
```

This modification ensures that if `tkinter` is not available, the program will print a message and exit gracefully instead of throwing an error. 

The rest of the files (`models.py`, `database.py`, and `schemas.py`) do not have any reported issues, so they remain unchanged.

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found, which typically means that the Python installation does not include the Tkinter library. To address this, we can provide instructions for the user to install Tkinter or suggest using a different GUI framework if Tkinter is not available. However, since the task is to modify the code based on the error summary, we will not change the code itself but rather provide a note in the documentation.

 The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found, which typically means that the Python installation does not include the Tkinter library. To address this, we can provide instructions for the user to install Tkinter or suggest using a different GUI framework if Tkinter is not available. However, since the task is to modify the code based on the error summary, we will not change the code itself but rather provide a note in the documentation.

Here are the modified codes based on the error summary:

**gui.py**
```python
```python
'''
Graphical User Interface for the Student application.
Note: Ensure that Tkinter is installed. If not, you can install it using your package manager.
For example, on Ubuntu, you can run: sudo apt-get install python3-tk

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found. This typically occurs when the Python installation does not include the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces. To resolve this issue, we can provide a check to ensure that the `tkinter` module is available before attempting to import it. If it is not available, we can print an error message and exit the application gracefully.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code structure and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, the `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary dependencies for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and any other libraries that are relevant to your project. Here’s how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
requests==2.28.1
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The main framework used for building the web application.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization.
- **requests**: Used in the GUI to make HTTP requests to the FastAPI backend.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers based on your specific needs or the latest stable releases at the time of your implementation. You can install these dependencies using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

This will ensure that all necessary packages are installed for your project to run smoothly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code structure and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, the `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary dependencies for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and any other libraries that are relevant to your project. Here’s how the `requirements.txt` file should look:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
requests==2.28.1
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The main framework used for building the web application.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization.
- **requests**: Used in the GUI to make HTTP requests to the FastAPI backend.
Make sure to adjust the version numbers based on your specific needs or the latest stable releases at the time of your implementation. You can install these dependencies using the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
This will ensure that all necessary packages are installed for your project to run smoothly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# Student Application User Manual

## Overview

The Student Application is a simple web application built using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite. It allows users to manage student records by adding student names to a database. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.

## Main Functions

- **Add Student**: Users can enter a student's name and submit it to be stored in the SQLite database.
- **Database Persistence**: The application automatically creates the necessary database schema on startup, ensuring that all student records are saved persistently.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the environment and run the Student Application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.11+ installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the application code:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd student_app
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pip. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
sqlalchemy
pydantic
requests
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the FastAPI Application

To start the FastAPI application, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Step 5: Run the GUI Application

In a new terminal window (keeping the FastAPI server running), run the GUI application:

```bash
python gui.py
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Open the GUI**: After running `gui.py`, a window will appear prompting you to enter a student's name.
2. **Add a Student**: Type the student's name in the input field and click the "Add Student" button.
3. **View Results**: The application will display a message indicating whether the student was added successfully or if there was an error.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following API endpoint:

- **POST /students/**: Adds a new student with the provided name in JSON format.

### Example Request

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

## Conclusion

The Student Application provides a simple yet effective way to manage student records using modern web technologies. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily set up and interact with the application. For any further questions or support, please reach out to the development team.
