To meet the customer's requirements for a simple web application that handles a Student entity, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a "Website." This would allow us to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the FastAPI backend and managing the Student entity effectively. 

What are your thoughts on this modality?

I agree that a "Website" is a suitable product modality for this task. It will provide an accessible interface for users to interact with the API and manage the Student entity seamlessly. Additionally, it aligns well with the requirements for a web application. 

Let's finalize this decision. What do you think?

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup".

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure our application into multiple files following best practices. The application will also include a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter framework.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and sets up the database.
   - `create_app()`: Initializes the FastAPI application.
   - `create_database()`: Creates the SQLite database and the Student table.

2. **models.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
   - `Student`: SQLAlchemy model representing the Student entity.

3. **database.py**: Handles the database connection and session management.
   - `get_db()`: Provides a database session for each request.

4. **api.py**: Contains the API endpoints for the Student entity.
   - `create_student()`: Endpoint to create a new student.
   - `get_students()`: Endpoint to retrieve all students.

5. **gui.py**: Implements the GUI using Tkinter.
   - `StudentApp`: Main class for the GUI application.
   - `add_student()`: Method to add a student through the GUI.
   - `show_students()`: Method to display all students in the GUI.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the overall functionality of the application. Here’s the detailed review:

1. **Importing Classes**: The `api.py` file does not import the necessary Pydantic model for request validation. We need to define a Pydantic model for the student creation request.

2. **Method Implementation**: The `create_student` method in `api.py` does not utilize a Pydantic model for input validation, which is a best practice in FastAPI applications.

3. **Comments**: While comments are present, they could be more descriptive, especially in the `create_student` and `get_students` functions to clarify the purpose and behavior of the API endpoints.

4. **Potential Bugs**: The `create_student` function does not handle the case where the name might already exist in the database. This could lead to duplicate entries if not managed.

5. **Conformance to User Tasks**: The overall structure is mostly compliant, but the lack of a Pydantic model for input validation is a significant oversight.

6. **User Interaction**: The GUI implementation in `gui.py` is functional, but it does not handle errors gracefully when the API is unreachable or when there are issues with the request.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the lack of a Pydantic model for the student creation request in `api.py`. This is essential for input validation and ensuring that the API behaves as expected.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create a Pydantic Model**: Add a new file `schemas.py` to define the Pydantic model for the Student entity.

**schemas.py**
```python
'''
Defines the Pydantic model for the Student entity.
'''
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. **Update `api.py`**: Modify the `create_student` function to use the new Pydantic model.

**api.py**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the Pydantic model

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Creates a new student.
    '''
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
```

3. **Error Handling in GUI**: Improve error handling in `gui.py` to provide better feedback to the user when the API is unreachable.

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust, maintainable, and compliant with best practices.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the application meets the requirements and operates smoothly.

3. **Comments**: While comments are present, they could be more descriptive, especially in the `create_student` and `get_students` functions to clarify the purpose and behavior of the API endpoints.

4. **Potential Bugs**: The `create_student` function does not handle the case where the name might already exist in the database. This could lead to duplicate entries if not managed.

5. **Conformance to User Tasks**: The overall structure is mostly compliant, but the lack of a Pydantic model for input validation is a significant oversight.

6. **User Interaction**: The GUI implementation in `gui.py` is functional, but it does not handle errors gracefully when the API is unreachable or when there are issues with the request.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the lack of a Pydantic model for the student creation request in `api.py`. This is essential for input validation and ensuring that the API behaves as expected.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create a Pydantic Model**: Add a new file `schemas.py` to define the Pydantic model for the Student entity.

**schemas.py**
```python
'''
Defines the Pydantic model for the Student entity.
'''
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. **Update `api.py`**: Modify the `create_student` function to use the new Pydantic model.

**api.py**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the Pydantic model

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Creates a new student.
    '''
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
```

3. **Error Handling in GUI**: Improve error handling in `gui.py` to provide better feedback to the user when the API is unreachable.

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust, maintainable, and compliant with best practices.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the application meets the requirements and operates smoothly.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the overall functionality of the application. Here’s the detailed review:

1. **Importing Classes**: The `api.py` file does not import the necessary Pydantic model for request validation. We need to define a Pydantic model for the student creation request.

2. **Method Implementation**: The `create_student` method in `api.py` does not utilize a Pydantic model for input validation, which is a best practice in FastAPI applications.

3. **Comments**: While comments are present, they could be more descriptive, especially in the `create_student` and `get_students` functions to clarify the purpose and behavior of the API endpoints.

4. **Potential Bugs**: The `create_student` function does not handle the case where the name might already exist in the database. This could lead to duplicate entries if not managed.

5. **Conformance to User Tasks**: The overall structure is mostly compliant, but the lack of a Pydantic model for input validation is a significant oversight.

6. **User Interaction**: The GUI implementation in `gui.py` is functional, but it does not handle errors gracefully when the API is unreachable or when there are issues with the request.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the lack of a Pydantic model for the student creation request in `api.py`. This is essential for input validation and ensuring that the API behaves as expected.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create a Pydantic Model**: Add a new file `schemas.py` to define the Pydantic model for the Student entity.

**schemas.py**
```python
'''
Defines the Pydantic model for the Student entity.
'''
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. **Update `api.py`**: Modify the `create_student` function to use the new Pydantic model.

**api.py**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the Pydantic model

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Creates a new student.
    '''
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
```

3. **Error Handling in GUI**: Improve error handling in `gui.py` to provide better feedback to the user when the API is unreachable.

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust, maintainable, and compliant with best practices.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the application meets the requirements and operates smoothly."

We need to define a Pydantic model for the student creation request.\n\n2. Method Implementation: The create_student method in api.py does not utilize a Pydantic model for input validation, which is a best practice in FastAPI applications.\n\n3. Comments: While comments are present, they could be more descriptive, especially in the create_student and get_students functions to clarify the purpose and behavior of the API endpoints.\n\n4. Potential Bugs: The create_student function does not handle the case where the name might already exist in the database. This could lead to duplicate entries if not managed.\n\n5. Conformance to User Tasks: The overall structure is mostly compliant, but the lack of a Pydantic model for input validation is a significant oversight.\n\n6. User Interaction: The GUI implementation in gui.py is functional, but it does not handle errors gracefully when the API is unreachable or when there are issues with the request.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the lack of a Pydantic model for the student creation request in api.py. This is essential for input validation and ensuring that the API behaves as expected.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code structure and implementation are generally well-organized, but there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance functionality. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing API Router Inclusion in FastAPI Application**

The `api.py` file defines the API endpoints, but there is no indication that the FastAPI application in `main.py` is including the router from `api.py`. This is crucial for the application to function correctly and respond to the defined endpoints.

### Suggested Revision:
1. In `main.py`, you need to import the FastAPI instance and the router from `api.py`, and include the router in the FastAPI application. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
# main.py
'''
Implements the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import create_database
from api import router  # Import the router

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database and tables on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    create_database()

# Include the router
app.include_router(router)
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that you have error handling in the API endpoints to manage cases where the database operations might fail.
- Consider adding a `GET` endpoint to retrieve a specific student by ID for more comprehensive functionality.
- Ensure that the FastAPI application is running on the expected host and port, and that the GUI is configured to point to the correct API endpoint.

By implementing these changes, the application will be fully operable and compliant with the user's requirements. 

If you make these adjustments, the application should work as intended.

The `api.py` file defines the API endpoints, but there is no indication that the FastAPI application in `main.py` is including the router from `api.py`. This is crucial for the application to function correctly and respond to the defined endpoints.

### Suggested Revision:
1. In `main.py`, you need to import the FastAPI instance and the router from `api.py`, and include the router in the FastAPI application. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
# main.py
'''
Implements the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import create_database
from api import router  # Import the router

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database and tables on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    create_database()

# Include the router
app.include_router(router)
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that you have error handling in the API endpoints to manage cases where the database operations might fail.
- Consider adding a `GET` endpoint to retrieve a specific student by ID for more comprehensive functionality.
- Ensure that the FastAPI application is running on the expected host and port, and that the GUI is configured to point to the correct API endpoint.

By implementing these changes, the application will be fully operable and compliant with the user's requirements. 

If you make these adjustments, the application should work as intended.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code structure and implementation are mostly correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application operates as intended and adheres to the best practices. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `StudentCreate` class is imported in `api.py`, which is correct. However, the `create_database` function in `database.py` is not called in `main.py`, which means the database schema won't be created automatically on startup.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented correctly.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present and adequately describe the methods.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - There are no apparent bugs in the code, but the database initialization is missing.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure and functionality align with the requirements.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI allows for interaction, but without the database initialization, the application will not function correctly.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The highest priority issue is that the database schema is not being created automatically on startup. You need to call the `create_database()` function in `main.py` to ensure that the database and tables are created when the application starts.

### Suggested Revision:
Add the following code to `main.py` to ensure the database is created on startup:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database and tables
create_database()

# Include the API router
from api import router
app.include_router(router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Instructions:
1. Ensure you have the FastAPI server running by executing `uvicorn main:app --reload` in your terminal.
2. Add the `create_database()` call in `main.py` as shown above.
3. Make sure to import `FastAPI` and `uvicorn` if they are not already imported.

This will ensure that the database schema is created automatically when the application starts, allowing the user to interact with the software without any issues.

- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found. This typically occurs when the Tkinter library is not installed or not available in the Python environment. To resolve this issue, we can provide instructions for installing Tkinter, as it is a standard library in Python but may not be included in some distributions.

### Explanation:
- I added a try-except block to check if the `tkinter` module can be imported. If it cannot, an informative error message is raised, guiding the user to install Tkinter.

With this modification, the application will provide a clear message if Tkinter is not available, allowing the user to take the necessary steps to resolve the issue.

[2025-28-10 23:38:23 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found. This typically occurs when the Tkinter library is not installed or not available in the Python environment. To resolve this issue, we can provide instructions for installing Tkinter, as it is a standard library in Python but may not be included in some distributions.

Here are the modified codes with explanations:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found. This typically means that the Tkinter library is not installed or not available in the Python environment being used. To resolve this issue, we can provide instructions for installing Tkinter, as it is a standard library in Python but may not be included in some distributions.

Here are the modifications based on the error summary:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found. This typically means that the Tkinter library is not installed or not available in the Python environment being used. To resolve this issue, we can provide instructions for installing Tkinter, as it is a standard library in Python but may not be included in some distributions.

- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Based on the provided code structure and the libraries used in your FastAPI web application, here is the `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
requests==2.28.1
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The main framework used for building the web application.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions with SQLite.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization of request and response models.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI for interacting with the FastAPI endpoints.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your specific needs or the latest stable releases if necessary. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

This `requirements.txt` file will ensure that all necessary packages are installed for the application to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

- **Show Students**: Users can view a list of all students stored in the database.

## Installation Guide

To run this application, you need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies. Follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the application files:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd student_app
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the FastAPI Application

Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This command will run the application on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The `--reload` flag enables auto-reload for development.

### Step 5: Run the GUI Application

In a separate terminal, run the GUI application:

```bash
python gui.py
```

This will open a Tkinter window where you can interact with the application.
