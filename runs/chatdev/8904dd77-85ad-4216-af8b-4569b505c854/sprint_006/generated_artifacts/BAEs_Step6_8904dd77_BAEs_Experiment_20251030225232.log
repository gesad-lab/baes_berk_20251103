To address the customer's task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be to use a **Dashboard**, as it can provide a real-time visualization of the relationships between Courses and Teachers, allowing users to see which teachers are assigned to which courses at a glance. 

Alternatively, a **Document** could be useful for providing detailed descriptions of the new relationships, including any changes to the database schema and migration strategies.

We could also consider a **Website** that presents this information interactively, allowing users to explore the Course and Teacher relationships dynamically.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the various product modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed allow for real-time visualization and could be very effective for users to understand the relationships between Courses and Teachers quickly. 

On the other hand, a **Document** would provide a comprehensive overview and detailed explanations, which could be beneficial for stakeholders who need to understand the technical aspects of the changes.

The **Website** option also offers interactivity, which could enhance user engagement and understanding of the relationships.

Given the nature of the task, I lean towards the **Dashboard** as it aligns well with the need for real-time data visualization and quick access to information. However, I see the value in the other options as well.

What do you think? Should we finalize on the Dashboard, or do you have a preference for another modality?

I agree that the **Dashboard** is a strong choice for this task, as it allows for real-time visualization and quick access to the relationships between Courses and Teachers. It can effectively communicate the necessary information in a user-friendly manner, which is essential for our customer.

While the Document and Website options have their merits, the Dashboard's ability to present data dynamically and visually makes it particularly suitable for this requirement. 

If we both see the value in the Dashboard and agree on it as our final product modality, we can proceed to finalize our decision. What do you think? Shall we go with the Dashboard?

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few key areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
1. **Missing Relationship Between Course and Teacher**: The `Course` model does not currently have a relationship defined with the `Teacher` model. This is crucial to fulfill the requirement that a course should be able to have a teacher.

### Suggested Revision:
To implement the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`, you need to add a foreign key reference in the `Course` model and update the relationship accordingly. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
       teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = "teachers"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` schema in `schemas.py`**:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str  # Course name
       level: str  # Course level
       teacher_id: int  # Add this line to accept teacher ID
   ```

4. **Update the `create_course` endpoint in `main.py`**:
   ```python
   @app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course
   ```

5. **Update the migration script in `migration.py`**:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       # Create the teachers table
       op.create_table(
           'teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True, autoincrement=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
       # Add teacher_id column to courses table
       op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id')))
   ```

### Summary:
By implementing these changes, you will establish a proper relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities, allowing each course to have an associated teacher. This will ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements and functions correctly.

[2025-30-10 22:53:01 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few key areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
1. **Missing Relationship Between Course and Teacher**: The `Course` model does not currently have a relationship defined with the `Teacher` model. This is crucial to fulfill the requirement that a course should be able to have a teacher.

### Suggested Revision:
To implement the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`, you need to add a foreign key reference in the `Course` model and update the relationship accordingly. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
       teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = "teachers"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` schema in `schemas.py`**:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str  # Course name
       level: str  # Course level
       teacher_id: int  # Add this line to accept teacher ID
   ```

4. **Update the `create_course` endpoint in `main.py`**:
   ```python
   @app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course
   ```

5. **Update the migration script in `migration.py`**:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       # Create the teachers table
       op.create_table(
           'teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True, autoincrement=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
       # Add teacher_id column to courses table
       op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id')))
   ```

### Summary:
By implementing these changes, you will establish a proper relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities, allowing each course to have an associated teacher. This will ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements and functions correctly.

Please proceed with these revisions to enhance the codebase.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few key areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
1. **Missing Relationship Between Course and Teacher**: The `Course` model does not currently have a relationship defined with the `Teacher` model. This is crucial to fulfill the requirement that a course should be able to have a teacher.

### Suggested Revision:
To implement the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`, you need to add a foreign key reference in the `Course` model and update the relationship accordingly. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
       teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = "teachers"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` schema in `schemas.py`**:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str  # Course name
       level: str  # Course level
       teacher_id: int  # Add this line to accept teacher ID
   ```

4. **Update the `create_course` endpoint in `main.py`**:
   ```python
   @app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course
   ```

5. **Update the migration script in `migration.py`**:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       # Create the teachers table
       op.create_table(
           'teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True, autoincrement=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
       # Add teacher_id column to courses table
       op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id')))
   ```

### Summary:
By implementing these changes, you will establish a proper relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities, allowing each course to have an associated teacher. This will ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements and functions correctly.

Please proceed with these revisions to enhance the codebase."

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Missing Relationship Between Course and Teacher: The Course model does not currently have a relationship defined with the Teacher model. This is crucial to fulfill the requirement that a course should be able to have a teacher.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\nTo implement the relationship between Course and Teacher, you need to add a foreign key reference in the Course model and update the relationship accordingly. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. Update the Course model in models.py:\n   python\n   class Course(Base):\n       __tablename__ = "courses"\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\'teachers.id\'))  # Add this line\n       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n       teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line\n\n\n2. Update the Teacher model in models.py:\n   python\n   class Teacher(Base):\n       __tablename__ = "teachers"\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line\n\n\n3. Update the CourseCreate schema in schemas.py:\n   python\n   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str  # Course name\n       level: str  # Course level\n       teacher_id: int  # Add this line to accept teacher ID\n\n\n4. Update the create_course endpoint in main.py:\n   python\n   @app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)\n   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line\n       db.add(db_course)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_course)\n       return db_course\n\n\n5. Update the migration script in migration.py:\n   python\n   def upgrade():\n       # Create the teachers table\n       op.create_table(\n           \'teachers\',\n           sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True, autoincrement=True),\n           sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n           sa.Column(\'email\', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n       )\n       # Add teacher_id column to courses table\n       op.add_column(\'courses\', sa.Column(\'teacher_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'teachers.id\')))\n\n\n### Summary:\nBy implementing these changes, you will establish a proper relationship between the Course and Teacher entities, allowing each course to have an associated teacher. This will ensure that the application meets the customer\'s requirements and functions correctly.\n\nPlease proceed with these revisions to enhance the codebase.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `migration.py` file does not include a step to ensure that existing data in the `courses` table is preserved when adding the `teacher_id` column. This could lead to data integrity issues if there are existing courses without a teacher assigned.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade()` function in `migration.py`** to ensure that the `teacher_id` column is added without affecting existing data. You can achieve this by first adding the column as nullable, then populating it with appropriate values if needed, and finally altering it to be non-nullable if required.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade()` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Step 1: Create the teachers table
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True, autoincrement=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Step 2: Add teacher_id column to courses table as nullable
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))
    
    # Step 3: (Optional) Populate teacher_id with default values if necessary
    # This step is optional and depends on your business logic.
    
    # Step 4: Alter the column to be non-nullable if needed
    # Uncomment the following line if you want to enforce teacher_id to be non-nullable
    # op.alter_column('courses', 'teacher_id', existing_type=sa.Integer(), nullable=False)
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that you have a strategy for populating the `teacher_id` for existing courses if you decide to make the column non-nullable.
- Test the migration thoroughly to confirm that existing data remains intact and that the application behaves as expected after the migration.

By implementing this change, you will ensure that the migration process does not disrupt existing data and adheres to the user's requirements.

If you implement this suggestion, the code will be more robust and compliant with the requirements.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script. The migration script does not include a step to ensure that existing data in the `courses` table is preserved when adding the `teacher_id` column. This could lead to data integrity issues if there are existing courses without a teacher.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The migration script should ensure that existing data in the `courses` table is preserved when adding the `teacher_id` column. You need to set a default value for the `teacher_id` column or handle existing records appropriately to avoid data loss.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. Modify the `upgrade` function in `migration.py` to set a default value for the `teacher_id` column when it is added. This can be done by first adding the column without a foreign key constraint, then populating it with a default value (e.g., `NULL`), and finally altering the column to enforce the foreign key constraint.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Step 1: Create the teachers table
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True, autoincrement=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Step 2: Add teacher_id column to courses table without foreign key constraint
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=True))
    
    # Step 3: (Optional) Set a default value for existing records if necessary
    # op.execute("UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = NULL")  # Set to NULL or a default teacher ID if applicable
    
    # Step 4: Add foreign key constraint to teacher_id column
    op.create_foreign_key('fk_teacher', 'courses', 'teachers', ['teacher_id'], ['id'])
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that you handle any existing data appropriately before enforcing the foreign key constraint.
- If you have existing courses that should be associated with a specific teacher, you may want to update those records accordingly before applying the foreign key constraint.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process does not lead to data loss and adheres to the requirements of the task.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# ChatDev Course Management System

Welcome to the ChatDev Course Management System! This software allows you to manage students, courses, and teachers efficiently. You can create, read, and enroll students in courses, as well as assign teachers to courses.

## Main Functions

### 1. Student Management
- **Create Student**: Add a new student with a name and email.
- **Read Students**: Retrieve a list of students with pagination.

### 2. Course Management
- **Create Course**: Add a new course with a name, level, and assigned teacher.
- **Read Courses**: Retrieve a list of courses with pagination.

### 3. Teacher Management
- **Create Teacher**: Add a new teacher with a name and email.
- **Read Teachers**: Retrieve a list of teachers with pagination.

### 4. Enrollment
- **Enroll Student in Course**: Enroll a student in a specific course.
- **Get Student Courses**: Retrieve all courses a student is enrolled in.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatdev-course-management.git
   cd chatdev-course-management
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   pydantic
   alembic
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Using the API

You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL. Below are some example requests:

### Create a Student
```http
POST /students/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### Create a Course
```http
POST /courses/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Mathematics 101",
  "level": "Beginner",
  "teacher_id": 1
}
```

### Create a Teacher
```http
POST /teachers/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
}
```

### Enroll a Student in a Course
```http
POST /students/1/courses/1
```

### Get Student Courses
```http
GET /students/1/courses
```

## Database Migration

To apply database migrations, ensure you have Alembic installed and run:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```
This will create the necessary tables and relationships in your database.

## Conclusion

This Course Management System provides a robust framework for managing educational entities. Feel free to explore the API and customize it to fit your needs. For further assistance, please refer to the documentation or reach out to our support team.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatdev-course-management.git
   cd chatdev-course-management
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   pydantic
   alembic
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application
