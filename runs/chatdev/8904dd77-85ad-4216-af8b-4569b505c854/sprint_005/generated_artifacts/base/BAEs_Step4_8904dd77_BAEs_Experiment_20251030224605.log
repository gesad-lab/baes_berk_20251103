To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be a **Dashboard**, which would allow us to visualize the relationship between students and their courses in real-time. This could include metrics such as the number of courses each student is enrolled in, progress tracking, and other relevant data.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Document** format, where we can provide detailed documentation on the new relationship, including schema changes and migration steps. This would be useful for technical stakeholders who need to understand the implementation details.

Another possibility is an **Application** that could allow users to interact with the Student and Course entities, providing a more hands-on approach to managing these relationships.

What are your thoughts on these modalities? Do you have a preference or any other ideas?

I appreciate your insights on the potential modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic and interactive way to visualize the relationship between students and courses, which could be beneficial for both administrators and users. It allows for real-time updates and can present various metrics in an engaging format.

On the other hand, a **Document** would serve as a comprehensive guide for the technical implementation, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the changes being made. However, it may lack the interactive element that a dashboard would provide.

The **Application** option could also be very effective, especially if we want to create a user-friendly interface for managing student-course relationships. It would allow for direct interaction and could be tailored to specific user needs.

Considering the nature of the task and the need for both clarity and interactivity, I lean towards the **Dashboard** as it can effectively communicate the relationship while also providing valuable insights.

What do you think? Should we proceed with the Dashboard, or do you have a different preference?

I agree that the **Dashboard** offers a compelling combination of interactivity and real-time data visualization, making it an excellent choice for showcasing the relationship between students and courses. It can provide valuable insights and allow users to engage with the data in a meaningful way.

While the Document and Application options have their merits, the Dashboard aligns well with our goal of presenting this new relationship in an accessible and informative manner. It can cater to both administrators and users, enhancing their understanding and management of student-course relationships.

Given our discussion and the consensus on the benefits of the Dashboard, I believe we should proceed with this modality.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are some critical aspects that need to be addressed to fulfill the requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. Here’s the detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` class is imported in `main.py`, but it is not utilized in a way that establishes a relationship with `Student`.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The methods for handling the relationship between `Student` and `Course` are missing.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present, but additional comments are needed for the new methods that will be added.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the logic for the relationship is incomplete.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The task of adding a relationship between `Student` and `Course` is not yet implemented.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The current implementation does not allow for students to have courses, which is a key requirement.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
The most critical issue is that the relationship between `Student` and `Course` has not been established in the models, and there are no methods to manage this relationship in the API.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` to include a relationship**:
   - Modify the `Student` model to include a relationship to the `Course` model. This can be done using a many-to-many relationship.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Add methods in `main.py` to manage the relationship**:
   - Implement endpoints to enroll a student in a course and to retrieve a student's courses.

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course"}

@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return student.courses
```

3. **Update the migration script**:
   - Create a new migration script to add the association table for the many-to-many relationship.

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirements of allowing students to have courses, and the database schema will be updated accordingly while preserving existing data.

### Final Instruction:
Please proceed to implement the suggested changes in the codebase to establish the relationship between `Student` and `Course` entities and to create the necessary API endpoints for managing this relationship.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are some critical aspects that need to be addressed to fulfill the requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. Here’s the detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` class is imported in `main.py`, but it is not utilized in a way that establishes a relationship with `Student`.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The methods for handling the relationship between `Student` and `Course` are missing.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present, but additional comments are needed for the new methods that will be added.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the logic for the relationship is incomplete.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The task of adding a relationship between `Student` and `Course` is not yet implemented.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The current implementation does not allow for students to have courses, which is a key requirement.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
The most critical issue is that the relationship between `Student` and `Course` has not been established in the models, and there are no methods to manage this relationship in the API.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` to include a relationship**:
   - Modify the `Student` model to include a relationship to the `Course` model. This can be done using a many-to-many relationship.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Add methods in `main.py` to manage the relationship**:
   - Implement endpoints to enroll a student in a course and to retrieve a student's courses.

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course"}

@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return student.courses
```

3. **Update the migration script**:
   - Create a new migration script to add the association table for the many-to-many relationship.

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirements of allowing students to have courses, and the database schema will be updated accordingly while preserving existing data.

### Final Instruction:
Please proceed to implement the suggested changes in the codebase to establish the relationship between `Student` and `Course` entities and to create the necessary API endpoints for managing this relationship."

Here’s the detailed review based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - The Course class is imported in main.py, but it is not utilized in a way that establishes a relationship with Student.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - The methods for handling the relationship between Student and Course are missing.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - Comments are present, but additional comments are needed for the new methods that will be added.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the logic for the relationship is incomplete.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The task of adding a relationship between Student and Course is not yet implemented.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - The current implementation does not allow for students to have courses, which is a key requirement.\n\n### Comment with the Highest Priority:\nThe most critical issue is that the relationship between Student and Course has not been established in the models, and there are no methods to manage this relationship in the API.\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. Update the models.py to include a relationship:\n   - Modify the Student model to include a relationship to the Course model. This can be done using a many-to-many relationship.\n\npython\nfrom sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n\n# Association table for the many-to-many relationship\nstudent_courses = Table(\n    \'student_courses\',\n    Base.metadata,\n    Column(\'student_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n    Column(\'course_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n)\n\nclass Student(Base):\n    __tablename__ = "students"\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")\n\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = "courses"\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n\n\n2. Add methods in main.py to manage the relationship:\n   - Implement endpoints to enroll a student in a course and to retrieve a student\'s courses.\n\npython\n@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")\ndef enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()\n    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n    if not student or not course:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")\n    student.courses.append(course)\n    db.commit()\n    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course"}\n\n@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])\ndef get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()\n    if not student:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")\n    return student.courses\n\n\n3. Update the migration script:\n   - Create a new migration script to add the association table for the many-to-many relationship.\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Create the association table\n    op.create_table(\n        \'student_courses\',\n        sa.Column(\'student_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column(\'course_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n    )\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirements of allowing students to have courses, and the database schema will be updated accordingly while preserving existing data.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease proceed to implement the suggested changes in the codebase to establish the relationship between Student and Course entities and to create the necessary API endpoints for managing this relationship.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements outlined in the task. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure full compliance with the regulations and to enhance the overall functionality and robustness of the application.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `enroll_student_in_course` method does not handle the case where a student is already enrolled in a course. This could lead to duplicate entries in the association table, which is not desirable in a many-to-many relationship.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Check for Existing Enrollment**: Before appending the course to the student's courses, check if the course is already in the student's courses list. If it is, return a message indicating that the student is already enrolled in that course.

Here’s how you can modify the `enroll_student_in_course` function:

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    
    # Check if the student is already enrolled in the course
    if course in student.courses:
        return {"msg": "Student is already enrolled in this course"}
    
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course"}
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- **Database Migration**: Ensure that the migration script is executed properly to reflect the changes in the database schema.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests to verify the functionality of the enrollment process and other CRUD operations to ensure they work as expected.

By implementing these changes, you will enhance the robustness of the application and ensure that it meets the requirements without introducing potential bugs.

If you make these adjustments, the code will be more reliable and user-friendly.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements specified by the customer, but there are a few areas that need attention to ensure full compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev. 

### Review of Regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - All necessary classes are imported in the respective files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented as required.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Most methods have comments, but some could benefit from more detailed explanations, especially around the logic of enrolling students in courses.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs, but the logic in the `enroll_student_in_course` method could be improved to handle duplicate enrollments.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project meets the requirements of adding a course relationship to the Student entity.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The interaction appears to be intact, but the logic for enrolling students could lead to issues if a student is already enrolled in a course.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `enroll_student_in_course` method does not check if a student is already enrolled in a course before adding them to the course. This could lead to duplicate entries in the `student_courses` association table.

### Suggestions for Revision:
To prevent duplicate enrollments, modify the `enroll_student_in_course` method as follows:

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    
    # Check if the student is already enrolled in the course
    if course in student.courses:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Student is already enrolled in this course")
    
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"msg": "Student enrolled in course"}
```

This change will ensure that a student cannot be enrolled in the same course multiple times, thus maintaining data integrity in the association table.

### Conclusion:
Make the suggested changes to the `enroll_student_in_course` method to enhance the robustness of the application.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented as required.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Most methods have comments, but some could benefit from more detailed explanations, especially around the logic of enrolling students in courses.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs, but the logic in the `enroll_student_in_course` method could be improved to handle duplicate enrollments.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Student Course Management System

A FastAPI application for managing students and their enrolled courses, allowing for easy tracking and organization of educational data.

## Main Functions

- **Student Management**: Create, read, and manage student records including their names and emails.
- **Course Management**: Create, read, and manage course records including course names and levels.
- **Enrollment**: Enroll students in courses and retrieve a list of courses a student is enrolled in.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-course-management.git
   cd student-course-management
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy alembic pydantic
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## 🤔 What is this?

This application is designed to help educational institutions manage student and course data efficiently. It allows for the creation of students and courses, as well as the ability to enroll students in various courses. The application uses a SQLite database to store data persistently.

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Creating a Student

To create a new student, send a POST request to `/students/` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### 2. Retrieving Students

To retrieve a list of students, send a GET request to `/students/`. You can also use query parameters `skip` and `limit` to paginate results.

### 3. Creating a Course

To create a new course, send a POST request to `/courses/` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "Mathematics 101",
  "level": "Beginner"
}
```

### 4. Retrieving Courses

To retrieve a list of courses, send a GET request to `/courses/`. You can also use query parameters `skip` and `limit` to paginate results.

### 5. Enrolling a Student in a Course

To enroll a student in a course, send a POST request to `/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}`. Replace `{student_id}` and `{course_id}` with the respective IDs.

### 6. Retrieving a Student's Courses

To get a list of courses a student is enrolled in, send a GET request to `/students/{student_id}/courses`.

## Database Migration

The application includes a migration script (`migration.py`) that updates the database schema to add the necessary tables and relationships. To run the migration, use Alembic commands:

1. **Run the migration**:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Downgrade if necessary**:
   ```bash
   alembic downgrade -1
   ```
