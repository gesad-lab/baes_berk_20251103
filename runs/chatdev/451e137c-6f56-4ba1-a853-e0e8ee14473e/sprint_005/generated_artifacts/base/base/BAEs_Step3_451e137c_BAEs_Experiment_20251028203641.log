To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information. Given the simplicity of the Course entity, I believe a few modalities could work well. 

1. **Document**: This could be a straightforward way to present the Course entity details in a structured format, making it easy for the customer to read and understand.

2. **Website**: A simple web page could effectively showcase the Course entity, allowing for easy navigation and potential future expansion if more features are needed.

3. **Dashboard**: If we want to visualize the Course entity alongside other educational data, a dashboard could provide a dynamic view.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the potential modalities. Here are my thoughts on the options you've presented:

1. **Document**: While this is a clear and structured way to present the information, it may lack interactivity and scalability for future needs.

2. **Website**: This option allows for flexibility and can be easily updated or expanded in the future. It also provides a user-friendly interface for the customer.

3. **Dashboard**: This could be beneficial if we anticipate the need to visualize data related to the Course entity, but it may be more complex than necessary for this specific task.

Considering the simplicity of the Course entity and the potential for future expansion, I lean towards the **Website** option. It strikes a good balance between presentation and flexibility. What do you think?

I agree with your assessment of the options. The **Website** modality indeed offers the flexibility and scalability we need for the Course entity. It allows us to present the information in an engaging way while also providing room for future enhancements or additional features. 

Given the simplicity of the Course entity and the potential for growth, I think we should proceed with the Website option as our final choice. 

Are we ready to finalize this decision?

Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided does not fulfill the customer's requirement to create a Course entity with name and level fields. Instead, it focuses solely on the Student entity. Here are the detailed reviews based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The necessary imports for the Course entity are missing.
2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods related to the Course entity.
3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments for Course-related methods are absent.
4. **No potential bugs**: While the existing code for the Student entity appears to be functional, it does not address the Course entity.
5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The task to create a Course entity is not addressed at all.
6. **User interaction without losing any feature**: The user cannot interact with a Course entity since it has not been implemented.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The code does not implement the required Course entity, which is essential to meet the customer's task. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course Model**: Add a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String
   from database import Base

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a Course Schema**: Add a new schema for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Add Course Routes**: Create a new route for the Course entity in `routes.py`:
   ```python
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
   def get_courses(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       return db.query(Course).all()
   ```

4. **Database Migration**: Create a migration script to add the Course table to the database, ensuring it preserves existing Student data.

5. **Update the main application**: If needed, update the GUI to allow interaction with the Course entity.

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer's requirements and allow for proper interaction with the Course entity.

       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a Course Schema**: Add a new schema for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Add Course Routes**: Create a new route for the Course entity in `routes.py`:
   ```python
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
   def get_courses(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       return db.query(Course).all()
   ```

4. **Database Migration**: Create a migration script to add the Course table to the database, ensuring it preserves existing Student data.

5. **Update the main application**: If needed, update the GUI to allow interaction with the Course entity.

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer's requirements and allow for proper interaction with the Course entity.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's request for creating a Course entity with name and level fields, updating the database schema, and ensuring that existing Student data is preserved, I will modify the existing codebase accordingly. Below are the updated codes for each file, formatted as requested.

[2025-28-10 20:37:29 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To fulfill the customer's request for creating a Course entity with name and level fields, updating the database schema, and ensuring that existing Student data is preserved, I will modify the existing codebase accordingly. Below are the updated codes for each file, formatted as requested.

### models.py
```python
'''
Defines the SQLAlchemy model for the Student and Course entities.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from database import Base

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

### schemas.py
```python
'''
Defines Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.
'''
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: str

class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

### routes.py
```python
'''
Contains the API endpoints for the Student and Course entities.
'''
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student, Course
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse, CourseCreate, CourseResponse

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    return db.query(Student).all()

@router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)

    return db_course

@router.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_courses(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    return db.query(Course).all()
```

### migration.py
```python
'''
Migration script to add Course table to the database.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Course

def upgrade(db: Session):
    # Create the Course table
    Course.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)

def downgrade(db: Session):
    # Drop the Course table if needed
    Course.__table__.drop(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
```

### database.py
```python
'''
Manages the SQLite database connection and session.
'''
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"

# Create the database engine
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
Base = declarative_base()

def get_db() -> Session:
    db = SessionLocal()

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script for the Course table. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `migration.py` script does not properly handle the creation of the Course table in a way that ensures existing Student data is preserved. Additionally, the `upgrade` function does not include a proper connection to the database session, which is essential for executing the migration.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `migration.py` script** to ensure that it correctly connects to the database session and creates the Course table while preserving existing data.

Here’s how you can revise the `migration.py`:

```python
'''
Migration script to add Course table to the database.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Course

def upgrade(db: Session):
    # Create the Course table if it does not exist
    Course.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)

def downgrade(db: Session):
    # Drop the Course table if needed
    Course.__table__.drop(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
```

### Additional Instructions:
- Ensure that you have a proper migration management tool (like Alembic) in place to handle migrations more effectively, which can help in managing the database schema changes without losing existing data.
- Test the migration process thoroughly to confirm that the existing Student data remains intact after the migration.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the Course table is created correctly while preserving the integrity of the existing Student data.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script for the Course table. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `migration.py` script does not properly handle the creation of the Course table in a way that ensures existing Student data is preserved. Additionally, the `upgrade` function does not include a proper connection to the database session, which is essential for executing the migration.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `migration.py` script** to ensure that it correctly connects to the database session and creates the Course table while preserving existing data.

Here’s how you can revise the `migration.py`:

```python
'''
Migration script to add Course table to the database.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Course

def upgrade(db: Session):
    # Create the Course table if it does not exist
    Course.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)

def downgrade(db: Session):
    # Drop the Course table if needed
    Course.__table__.drop(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
```

### Additional Instructions:
- Ensure that you have a proper migration management tool (like Alembic) in place to handle migrations more effectively, which can help in managing the database schema changes without losing existing data.
- Test the migration process thoroughly to confirm that the existing Student data remains intact after the migration.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the Course table is created correctly while preserving the integrity of the existing Student data.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here’s the detailed review:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` class is imported in `routes.py`, `models.py`, and `schemas.py`, which is correct.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods in the provided code are implemented.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - The comments in the code are generally adequate, but some methods could benefit from additional comments to clarify their purpose.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors, but there are some logical issues that could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project meets the requirements for creating a `Course` entity and updating the database schema.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI allows for interaction with both `Student` and `Course` entities, but there is a potential issue with the database migration logic.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script for adding the `Course` table (`migration.py`) does not ensure that the existing `Student` data is preserved correctly during the migration process. While the `upgrade` function creates the `Course` table, it does not handle any potential issues that could arise if the migration is run multiple times or if the database is in an unexpected state.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the migration script to include checks for existing data**:
   - Modify the `upgrade` function to ensure that the migration does not interfere with existing `Student` data. You can add checks to see if the `Course` table already exists before attempting to create it.

Here’s a revised version of the `migration.py`:

```python
'''
Migration script to add Course table to the database.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Course

def upgrade(db: Session):
    # Check if the Course table already exists
    if not db.has_table(Course.__tablename__):
        # Create the Course table if it does not exist
        Course.__table__.create(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)

def downgrade(db: Session):
    # Drop the Course table if needed
    if db.has_table(Course.__tablename__):
        Course.__table__.drop(bind=db.bind, checkfirst=True)
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the database connection is properly managed during migrations, and consider adding error handling to the migration process to catch any exceptions that may occur.
- Consider adding unit tests for the migration scripts to verify that they work as expected.

By implementing these changes, you will enhance the robustness of the migration process and ensure that existing data is preserved during updates.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Explanation:
The error reported was a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `tkinter` module. The code provided does not need any modifications to resolve this error, as it is an environment issue rather than a code issue. The user must ensure that the `tkinter` module is installed in their Python environment. 

If the user is using a standard Python installation, `tkinter` should be included. If it is not, they may need to install it separately depending on their operating system. 

Thus, no changes were made to the code, and the output is simply "<INFO> Finished".

### Explanation of Changes:
- Added a try-except block to check for the availability of the `tkinter` module. If it is not installed, the program will print an error message and exit gracefully. This resolves the `ModuleNotFoundError` reported in the test summary.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Explanation:
- The error report indicated that the `tkinter` module was not found. To resolve this, I ensured that the code includes an error message that prompts the user to install `tkinter` if it is not available. This is already present in the code, so no changes were needed in that regard. The code is structured correctly and should work as intended once the `tkinter` module is installed.

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in the project, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your FastAPI application, including SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Pydantic for data validation:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
requests==2.28.1
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to create the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to interact with the API.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers as necessary based on your project's requirements or the latest stable releases.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries used in the project, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your FastAPI application, including SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Pydantic for data validation:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
requests==2.28.1
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to create the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to interact with the API.
Make sure to adjust the version numbers as necessary based on your project's requirements or the latest stable releases. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
