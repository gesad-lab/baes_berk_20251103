To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider the best product modality that can effectively present this information and facilitate the necessary updates. 

I believe a **Dashboard** could be a strong choice, as it can visualize the relationships between students and courses in real-time, allowing for dynamic interaction and insights into the data. This would enable users to see which students are enrolled in which courses and manage these relationships effectively.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think another modality might serve the purpose better?

I appreciate your input on the Dashboard as a potential modality. However, I believe a **Document** might be more appropriate for this task. It can provide a detailed explanation of the changes made to the database schema, including the relationship between Student and Course entities, along with migration strategies to preserve existing data. This would ensure clarity and thorough documentation for the customer.

What do you think about this approach? Would you prefer to stick with the Dashboard, or do you see the value in a Document?

Your point about using a **Document** is valid, especially for providing detailed explanations and documentation of the changes made to the database schema. It would ensure that the customer has a clear understanding of the modifications and the migration process.

However, I still see significant value in the **Dashboard** for visualizing the relationships and providing an interactive experience. Perhaps we could consider a hybrid approach where we create a Document for detailed explanations and also develop a Dashboard for real-time visualization of the relationships.

What do you think about this hybrid approach? Or do you still prefer to focus solely on the Document?

The hybrid approach you propose is indeed compelling, as it combines the strengths of both modalities. A **Document** would provide the necessary detailed explanations and documentation, while a **Dashboard** would offer real-time visualization and interactivity for users to engage with the data effectively.

This combination would cater to different user needs, ensuring that both technical documentation and user-friendly visualization are available. 

If we can agree on this hybrid approach, we can move forward with it. What do you think? Shall we finalize this decision?

The code provided does not currently implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. Specifically, we need to establish a many-to-many relationship, as a student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Many-to-Many Relationship Implementation:**
The current implementation lacks a relationship between `Student` and `Course`. To fulfill the requirement of allowing students to have courses, we need to create an association table to represent this many-to-many relationship.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create an Association Table:**
   Add a new model for the association table that links `Student` and `Course`.

```python
class StudentCourse(Base):
    '''
    Association table for the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.
    '''
    __tablename__ = "student_courses"
    student_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True)
    course_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
```

2. **Update the `Student` and `Course` Models:**
   Modify the `Student` and `Course` models to include relationships.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="courses")
```

3. **Update Database Migration:**
   Create a new migration script to add the `student_courses` table.

```python
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('student_courses')
```

4. **Update API Endpoints:**
   Implement endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve their courses.

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found.")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully."}

@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found.")
    return student.courses
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added an association table `student_courses`.
- Updated `Student` and `Course` models to include relationships.
- Created a migration script for the new association table.
- Added API endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve courses for a student.

Implementing these changes will ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements and allows students to have courses.

The current implementation lacks a relationship between `Student` and `Course`. To fulfill the requirement of allowing students to have courses, we need to create an association table to represent this many-to-many relationship.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create an Association Table:**
   Add a new model for the association table that links `Student` and `Course`.

```python
class StudentCourse(Base):
    '''
    Association table for the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.
    '''
    __tablename__ = "student_courses"
    student_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True)
    course_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
```

2. **Update the `Student` and `Course` Models:**
   Modify the `Student` and `Course` models to include relationships.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="courses")
```

3. **Update Database Migration:**
   Create a new migration script to add the `student_courses` table.

```python
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('student_courses')
```

4. **Update API Endpoints:**
   Implement endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve their courses.

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found.")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully."}

@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found.")
    return student.courses
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added an association table `student_courses`.
- Updated `Student` and `Course` models to include relationships.
- Created a migration script for the new association table.
- Added API endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve courses for a student.

Implementing these changes will ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements and allows students to have courses.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided does not currently implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. Specifically, we need to establish a many-to-many relationship, as a student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Many-to-Many Relationship Implementation:**
The current implementation lacks a relationship between `Student` and `Course`. To fulfill the requirement of allowing students to have courses, we need to create an association table to represent this many-to-many relationship.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create an Association Table:**
   Add a new model for the association table that links `Student` and `Course`.

```python
class StudentCourse(Base):
    '''
    Association table for the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.
    '''
    __tablename__ = "student_courses"
    student_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True)
    course_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
```

2. **Update the `Student` and `Course` Models:**
   Modify the `Student` and `Course` models to include relationships.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="courses")
```

3. **Update Database Migration:**
   Create a new migration script to add the `student_courses` table.

```python
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(

        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('student_courses')
```

4. **Update API Endpoints:**
   Implement endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve their courses.

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found.")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully."}

@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found.")
    return student.courses
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added an association table `student_courses`.
- Updated `Student` and `Course` models to include relationships.
- Created a migration script for the new association table.
- Added API endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve courses for a student.

Implementing these changes will ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements and allows students to have courses."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary changes to implement the many-to-many relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, as well as the required database migration and API endpoints.

To fulfill the requirement of allowing students to have courses, we need to create an association table to represent this many-to-many relationship.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Create an Association Table:\n   Add a new model for the association table that links Student and Course.\n\npython\nclass StudentCourse(Base):\n    \'\'\'\n    Association table for the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.\n    \'\'\'\n    __tablename__ = "student_courses"\n    student_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True)\n    course_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n\n\n2. Update the Student and Course Models:\n   Modify the Student and Course models to include relationships.\n\npython\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n\nclass Student(Base):\n    __tablename__ = "students"\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    courses = relationship("Course", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="students")\n\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = "courses"\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="courses")\n\n\n3. Update Database Migration:\n   Create a new migration script to add the student_courses table.\n\npython\nfrom alembic import op\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\n\ndef upgrade():\n    op.create_table(\n        \'student_courses\',\n        sa.Column(\'student_id\', sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column(\'course_id\', sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n    )\n\ndef downgrade():\n    op.drop_table(\'student_courses\')\n\n\n4. Update API Endpoints:\n   Implement endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve their courses.\n\npython\n@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")\ndef enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()\n    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n    if not student or not course:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found.")\n    student.courses.append(course)\n    db.commit()\n    return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully."}\n\n@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])\ndef get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()\n    if not student:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found.")\n    return student.courses\n\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n- Added an association table student_courses.\n- Updated Student and Course models to include relationships.\n- Created a migration script for the new association table.\n- Added API endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve courses for a student.\n\nImplementing these changes will ensure that the software meets the customer\'s requirements and allows students to have courses.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided largely meets the requirements for adding a course relationship to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the application functions correctly and adheres to the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Order**: The migration scripts for adding the `student_courses` association table should be executed before the application attempts to create the tables in `database.py` and `main.py`. This ensures that the association table exists before any relationships are established.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Migration Order**: Ensure that the migration for creating the `student_courses` table is run before the application starts. This can be done by using Alembic to manage migrations properly. You should run the migration scripts in the correct order before starting the FastAPI application.

2. **Database Initialization Logic**: Remove the checks for table existence in `database.py` and `main.py` after the migrations are applied. Instead, rely on Alembic to handle the creation of tables and relationships.

3. **Testing Relationships**: Ensure that there are tests in place to verify that students can be enrolled in courses and that the relationships are correctly established. This can be done by writing unit tests or integration tests.

4. **Documentation**: Ensure that all methods have clear and concise comments explaining their purpose and functionality. This will help future developers understand the codebase better.

5. **Error Handling**: Consider adding more specific error handling for cases where a student or course is not found during enrollment, to provide clearer feedback to the API users.

### Implementation Steps:
- Run the Alembic migrations to create the `student_courses` table before starting the FastAPI application.
- Remove the table existence checks in `database.py` and `main.py` after ensuring migrations are applied.
- Add unit tests to verify the functionality of enrolling students in courses and retrieving their courses.
- Review and enhance comments in the code for clarity.

By addressing these points, the application will be more robust and compliant with the requirements set forth by the customer.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements of the task. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure that the software operates correctly and meets all the regulations outlined.

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `get_student_courses` endpoint should return a list of `CourseResponse` objects, but currently, it returns the raw `student.courses` which are `Course` objects. This will lead to a serialization issue since the response model expects a list of `CourseResponse` objects.

**Suggested Revision:**
In the `get_student_courses` function, you need to convert the `student.courses` into a list of `CourseResponse` objects before returning them. Here’s how you can modify the function:

```python
@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Retrieve courses for a specific student.
    '''
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found.")
    return [CourseResponse(id=course.id, name=course.name, level=course.level, students=[]) for course in student.courses]
```

This change ensures that the response conforms to the expected schema and that the API behaves as intended.

**Instructions for Fix:**
1. Locate the `get_student_courses` function in `main.py`.
2. Replace the return statement with the modified code provided above.
3. Test the endpoint to ensure it returns the correct response format.

By implementing this change, the code will adhere to the requirements and ensure proper functionality. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements of the task. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure that the software operates correctly and meets all the regulations outlined.

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `get_student_courses` endpoint should return a list of `CourseResponse` objects, but currently, it returns the raw `student.courses` which are `Course` objects. This will lead to a serialization issue since the response model expects a list of `CourseResponse` objects.

**Suggested Revision:**
In the `get_student_courses` function, you need to convert the `student.courses` into a list of `CourseResponse` objects before returning them. Here’s how you can modify the function:

```python
@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Retrieve courses for a specific student.
    '''
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found.")
    return [CourseResponse(id=course.id, name=course.name, level=course.level, students=[]) for course in student.courses]
```

This change ensures that the response conforms to the expected schema and that the API behaves as intended.

**Instructions for Fix:**
1. Locate the `get_student_courses` function in `main.py`.
2. Replace the return statement with the modified code provided above.
3. Test the endpoint to ensure it returns the correct response format.

By implementing this change, the code will adhere to the requirements and ensure proper functionality. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: A lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project's requirements or the latest stable versions available at the time of your implementation.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
