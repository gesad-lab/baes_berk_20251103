To effectively meet the customer's requirements for a simple web application, I believe the best product modality would be a Website. This would allow us to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Student entity and provide the necessary API responses in JSON format. What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that a Website would be an excellent choice for this project. It allows for easy interaction with the API and can present the data in a clear and accessible manner. Additionally, it aligns well with the customer's need for a simple web application. Let's proceed with this modality. What do you think?

I completely agree with your assessment. A Website is indeed the most suitable modality for this project, as it provides the necessary functionality for users to interact with the Student entity and access the API seamlessly. It also ensures that we can implement best practices for structuring the application. Let's finalize this decision.

Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup".

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure the application into multiple files. The core classes and functions will include:

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and sets up the routes.
2. **models.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
3. **database.py**: Responsible for setting up the SQLite database and creating the tables.
4. **schemas.py**: Defines the Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.
5. **gui.py**: Implements a simple GUI using Tkinter to interact with the API.

### Core Classes and Functions Overview

- **main.py**:
  - `create_app()`: Initializes the FastAPI application and sets up routes.
  - `get_students()`: Endpoint to retrieve all students.
  - `create_student()`: Endpoint to create a new student.

- **models.py**:
  - `Student`: SQLAlchemy model representing the Student entity.

- **database.py**:
  - `get_db()`: Provides a database session.
  - `init_db()`: Initializes the database and creates tables.

- **schemas.py**:
  - `StudentCreate`: Pydantic model for creating a student.
  - `StudentResponse`: Pydantic model for returning student data.

- **gui.py**:
  - `StudentApp`: Tkinter application to interact with the FastAPI backend.

Now, let's implement the code for each of these files.

### 1. main.py

```python
'''

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    return db.query(Student).all()
```

### 2. models.py

```python
'''

    __tablename__ = 'students'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

### 3. database.py

```python
'''

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session
from models import Base

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"

engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

def get_db() -> Session:
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

def init_db():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = StudentApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
```

### Running the Application

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Importing All Referenced Classes**: 
   - The `main.py` file does not import the necessary FastAPI components or the database session. You need to import `FastAPI`, `Depends`, and the `get_db` function from `database.py`.

2. **Implementing All Methods**: 
   - The FastAPI application is missing. You need to create a FastAPI instance and define the necessary routes for creating and listing students.

3. **Necessary Comments**: 
   - While the existing comments are helpful, the FastAPI routes should also have comments explaining their purpose.

4. **No Potential Bugs**: 
   - The code does not handle potential errors when interacting with the database (e.g., when adding a student). You should implement error handling in the FastAPI routes.

5. **Conformance to User Tasks**: 
   - The FastAPI application is not defined in the provided code, which is essential for fulfilling the user's requirement.

6. **Logic of Code**: 
   - The logic for the FastAPI application is missing, which means the user cannot interact with the software as intended.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the FastAPI application is not implemented in the provided code. Without this, the user cannot interact with the software as required.

### Suggested Revision:
To address this, you need to create a new file, `main.py`, that initializes the FastAPI application and defines the necessary routes. Here’s an example of how you can implement it:

```python
# main.py
'''
Main application file for the FastAPI backend.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import init_db, get_db
from models import Student
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize the database on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    init_db()

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Instructions:
1. Create a new file named `main.py` and add the above code.
2. Ensure that you have the FastAPI and SQLAlchemy libraries installed in your environment.
3. Run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
4. Test the application using the provided Tkinter GUI to ensure it interacts correctly with the FastAPI backend.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable, and the user will be able to interact with it as intended.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Importing All Referenced Classes**: 
   - The `main.py` file does not import the necessary FastAPI components or the database session. You need to import `FastAPI`, `Depends`, and the `get_db` function from `database.py`.

2. **Implementing All Methods**: 
   - The FastAPI application is missing. You need to create a FastAPI instance and define the necessary routes for creating and listing students.

3. **Necessary Comments**: 
   - While the existing comments are helpful, the FastAPI routes should also have comments explaining their purpose.

4. **No Potential Bugs**: 
   - The code does not handle potential errors when interacting with the database (e.g., when adding a student). You should implement error handling in the FastAPI routes.

5. **Conformance to User Tasks**: 
   - The FastAPI application is not defined in the provided code, which is essential for fulfilling the user's requirement.

6. **Logic of Code**: 
   - The logic for the FastAPI application is missing, which means the user cannot interact with the software as intended.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the FastAPI application is not implemented in the provided code. Without this, the user cannot interact with the software as required.

### Suggested Revision:
To address this, you need to create a new file, `main.py`, that initializes the FastAPI application and defines the necessary routes. Here’s an example of how you can implement it:

```python
# main.py
'''
Main application file for the FastAPI backend.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import init_db, get_db
from models import Student
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize the database on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    init_db()

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Instructions:
1. Create a new file named `main.py` and add the above code.
2. Ensure that you have the FastAPI and SQLAlchemy libraries installed in your environment.
3. Run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
4. Test the application using the provided Tkinter GUI to ensure it interacts correctly with the FastAPI backend.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable, and the user will be able to interact with it as intended."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Importing All Referenced Classes: \n   - The main.py file does not import the necessary FastAPI components or the database session. You need to import FastAPI, Depends, and the get_db function from database.py.\n\n2. Implementing All Methods: \n   - The FastAPI application is missing. You need to create a FastAPI instance and define the necessary routes for creating and listing students.\n\n3. Necessary Comments: \n   - While the existing comments are helpful, the FastAPI routes should also have comments explaining their purpose.\n\n4. No Potential Bugs: \n   - The code does not handle potential errors when interacting with the database (e.g., when adding a student). You should implement error handling in the FastAPI routes.\n\n5. Conformance to User Tasks: \n   - The FastAPI application is not defined in the provided code, which is essential for fulfilling the user\'s requirement.\n\n6. Logic of Code: \n   - The logic for the FastAPI application is missing, which means the user cannot interact with the software as intended.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is that the FastAPI application is not implemented in the provided code. Without this, the user cannot interact with the software as required.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\nTo address this, you need to create a new file, main.py, that initializes the FastAPI application and defines the necessary routes. Here’s an example of how you can implement it:\n\npython\n# main.py\n\'\'\'\nMain application file for the FastAPI backend.\n\'\'\'\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\nfrom database import init_db, get_db\nfrom models import Student\nfrom schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Initialize the database on startup\n@app.on_event("startup")\ndef startup_event():\n    init_db()\n\n@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)\ndef create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    db_student = Student(name=student.name)\n    db.add(db_student)\n    db.commit()\n    db.refresh(db_student)\n    return db_student\n\n@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])\ndef read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()\n    return students\n\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Create a new file named main.py and add the above code.\n2. Ensure that you have the FastAPI and SQLAlchemy libraries installed in your environment.\n3. Run the FastAPI application using uvicorn main:app --reload.\n4. Test the application using the provided Tkinter GUI to ensure it interacts correctly with the FastAPI backend.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will be operable, and the user will be able to interact with it as intended.'} |

- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the overall functionality of the application.

### Review of Regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - All necessary imports are present in each file.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented correctly.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present and adequately describe the methods.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project meets the requirements outlined in the task.

6. **User interaction with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The API endpoints are correctly set up for creating and retrieving students.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The current implementation of the `create_student` function does not handle the case where a student with the same name already exists. This could lead to duplicate entries in the database, which is not ideal for data integrity.

### Suggestions for Revision:
To address this issue, I recommend adding a check in the `create_student` function to see if a student with the same name already exists before creating a new entry. Here’s how you can implement this:

```python
@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Create a new student in the database.
    '''
    # Check if the student already exists
    existing_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.name == student.name).first()
    if existing_student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Student with this name already exists.")
    
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student
```

This addition will ensure that the application does not allow duplicate student entries based on the name field, thus maintaining data integrity.

### Conclusion:
Implementing this change will enhance the robustness of the application and ensure compliance with best practices for data management.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `create_student` function does not handle the case where the student name already exists in the database. This could lead to potential data integrity issues and does not conform to best practices for unique constraints on entities.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Add a check to ensure that the student name is unique before creating a new student.** This can be done by querying the database to see if a student with the same name already exists. If it does, raise an `HTTPException` with a 400 status code.

Here is the revised `create_student` function with the necessary checks:

```python
@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Create a new student in the database.
    '''
    # Check if the student with the same name already exists
    existing_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.name == student.name).first()
    if existing_student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Student with this name already exists.")
    
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student
```

### Instructions on Fix:
- Replace the existing `create_student` function in `main.py` with the revised version above.
- Test the application to ensure that it correctly handles attempts to create duplicate students by returning a proper error message.

By implementing this change, the application will better adhere to best practices and ensure data integrity.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

    db_student = Student(name=student.name)

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `create_student` function does not handle the case where the student name already exists in the database. This could lead to potential data integrity issues and does not conform to best practices for unique constraints on entities.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Add a check to ensure that the student name is unique before creating a new student.** This can be done by querying the database to see if a student with the same name already exists. If it does, raise an `HTTPException` with a 400 status code.

Here is the revised `create_student` function with the necessary checks:

```python
@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Create a new student in the database.
    '''
    # Check if the student with the same name already exists
    existing_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.name == student.name).first()
    if existing_student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Student with this name already exists.")
    
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student
```

### Instructions on Fix:
- Replace the existing `create_student` function in `main.py` with the revised version above.
- Test the application to ensure that it correctly handles attempts to create duplicate students by returning a proper error message.

By implementing this change, the application will better adhere to best practices and ensure data integrity.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Based on the provided code for the FastAPI web application, the following dependencies are required to ensure the application runs properly. The main dependencies include FastAPI, SQLAlchemy for ORM, and an ASGI server like Uvicorn to serve the application. Here is the `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used to interact with the SQLite database.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization of request and response models.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers according to the latest stable releases if necessary. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code for the FastAPI web application, the following dependencies are required to ensure the application runs properly. The main dependencies include FastAPI, SQLAlchemy for ORM, and an ASGI server like Uvicorn to serve the application. Here is the `requirements.txt` file:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used to interact with the SQLite database.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization of request and response models.
Make sure to adjust the version numbers according to the latest stable releases if necessary. You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Student Management API

A simple web application for managing student records using FastAPI and SQLite.

## 🚀 Introduction

This application allows users to create and retrieve student records. Each student has a name, which is a required field. The application is built using Python 3.11+ with the FastAPI framework and uses SQLite for data persistence. The API returns JSON responses for all requests.

### Main Functions

- **Create a Student**: Allows you to add a new student by providing their name.
- **Retrieve Students**: Fetches a list of students from the database with pagination support.

## 📦 Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   pydantic
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🛠️ Running the Application

To start the FastAPI application, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
This command will start the server with auto-reload enabled, allowing you to see changes without restarting the server.

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
