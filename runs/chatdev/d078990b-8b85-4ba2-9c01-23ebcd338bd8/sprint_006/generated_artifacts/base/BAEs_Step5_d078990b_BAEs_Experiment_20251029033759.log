To address the customer's task of creating a Teacher entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be a Document format, which would allow us to provide a detailed description of the Teacher entity, including the fields and requirements. This could be useful for documentation purposes.

Alternatively, we could consider a Dashboard format, which could visualize the Teacher data alongside existing Student and Course data, providing a more interactive experience for users.

Another possibility is a Website format, which could allow for a more dynamic presentation of the Teacher entity and could include forms for adding new teachers directly.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the different product modalities. 

The Document format is indeed useful for detailed documentation, but it may not provide the interactive experience that users might expect when managing entities like Teacher, Student, and Course data.

The Dashboard format is compelling as it allows for real-time visualization and interaction with the data, making it easier for users to manage and view relationships between entities.

The Website format also has its advantages, especially in terms of user engagement and the ability to add new entries dynamically. It could serve as a platform for users to interact with the Teacher entity and potentially other related entities.

Considering the need for interactivity and user engagement, I lean towards the Dashboard format, as it can effectively visualize the Teacher entity alongside existing data while allowing for real-time updates.

What do you think? Should we proceed with the Dashboard format?

I agree with your assessment of the Dashboard format. It indeed provides the interactivity and real-time visualization that would enhance user experience when managing the Teacher entity alongside existing Student and Course data. This modality allows for a comprehensive view and facilitates better decision-making for users.

Given the importance of interactivity and the ability to visualize relationships between entities, I believe we should proceed with the Dashboard format as our final product modality.

Are we all in agreement on this? If so, I will conclude our discussion.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are several areas that need to be addressed to fully comply with the customer's requirements and the regulations set by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Teacher` class is not defined or imported in any of the files. This is essential as the task requires creating a `Teacher` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There are no methods implemented for creating, reading, or managing `Teacher` entities in `main.py`. This is a critical omission.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for `Teacher` will also need appropriate comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The current code does not have any apparent bugs, but without the `Teacher` entity, the application will not function as intended.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project does not conform to the user's task as the `Teacher` entity is missing.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The absence of the `Teacher` entity means that users cannot interact with the software to manage teachers, which is a critical requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the `Teacher` entity and its corresponding methods in the application. This needs to be addressed immediately to fulfill the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Teacher Model**: In `models.py`, create a `Teacher` class similar to the `Student` and `Course` classes.
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       '''
       Teacher entity model.
       '''
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Pydantic Schemas**: In `schemas.py`, create schemas for creating and responding with `Teacher` data.
   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for creating a new teacher.
       '''
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for teacher response.
       '''
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str
   ```

3. **Implement CRUD Operations**: In `main.py`, add endpoints for creating and reading teachers.
   ```python
   @app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Create a new teacher in the database.
       '''
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])
   def read_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Retrieve a list of teachers from the database.
       '''
       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return teachers
   ```

4. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database migration script is updated to include the new `Teacher` table without affecting existing `Student` and `Course` data.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements and adhere to the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Final Instruction:
Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project does not conform to the user's task as the `Teacher` entity is missing.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The absence of the `Teacher` entity means that users cannot interact with the software to manage teachers, which is a critical requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the `Teacher` entity and its corresponding methods in the application. This needs to be addressed immediately to fulfill the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Teacher Model**: In `models.py`, create a `Teacher` class similar to the `Student` and `Course` classes.
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       '''
       Teacher entity model.
       '''
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Pydantic Schemas**: In `schemas.py`, create schemas for creating and responding with `Teacher` data.
   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for creating a new teacher.
       '''
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for teacher response.
       '''
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str
   ```

3. **Implement CRUD Operations**: In `main.py`, add endpoints for creating and reading teachers.
   ```python
   @app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Create a new teacher in the database.
       '''
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])
   def read_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Retrieve a list of teachers from the database.
       '''
       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return teachers
   ```

4. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database migration script is updated to include the new `Teacher` table without affecting existing `Student` and `Course` data.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements and adhere to the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Final Instruction:
Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are several areas that need to be addressed to fully comply with the customer's requirements and the regulations set by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Teacher` class is not defined or imported in any of the files. This is essential as the task requires creating a `Teacher` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There are no methods implemented for creating, reading, or managing `Teacher` entities in `main.py`. This is a critical omission.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for `Teacher` will also need appropriate comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The current code does not have any apparent bugs, but without the `Teacher` entity, the application will not function as intended.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project does not conform to the user's task as the `Teacher` entity is missing.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The absence of the `Teacher` entity means that users cannot interact with the software to manage teachers, which is a critical requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the `Teacher` entity and its corresponding methods in the application. This needs to be addressed immediately to fulfill the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Teacher Model**: In `models.py`, create a `Teacher` class similar to the `Student` and `Course` classes.

       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Pydantic Schemas**: In `schemas.py`, create schemas for creating and responding with `Teacher` data.
   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for creating a new teacher.
       '''
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for teacher response.
       '''
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str
   ```

3. **Implement CRUD Operations**: In `main.py`, add endpoints for creating and reading teachers.
   ```python
   @app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Create a new teacher in the database.
       '''
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])
   def read_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Retrieve a list of teachers from the database.
       '''
       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return teachers
   ```

4. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database migration script is updated to include the new `Teacher` table without affecting existing `Student` and `Course` data.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements and adhere to the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Final Instruction:
Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary changes implemented to fulfill the customer's requirements for creating a `Teacher` entity, along with the corresponding CRUD operations and database migration.

Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - The Teacher class is not defined or imported in any of the files. This is essential as the task requires creating a Teacher entity.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - There are no methods implemented for creating, reading, or managing Teacher entities in main.py. This is a critical omission.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for Teacher will also need appropriate comments.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The current code does not have any apparent bugs, but without the Teacher entity, the application will not function as intended.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The project does not conform to the user\'s task as the Teacher entity is missing.\n\n6. User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - The absence of the Teacher entity means that users cannot interact with the software to manage teachers, which is a critical requirement.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the absence of the Teacher entity and its corresponding methods in the application. This needs to be addressed immediately to fulfill the customer\'s requirements.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Define the Teacher Model: In models.py, create a Teacher class similar to the Student and Course classes.\n   python\n   class Teacher(Base):\n       \'\'\'\n       Teacher entity model.\n       \'\'\'\n       __tablename__ = \'teachers\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Create Pydantic Schemas: In schemas.py, create schemas for creating and responding with Teacher data.\n   python\n   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):\n       \'\'\'\n       Schema for creating a new teacher.\n       \'\'\'\n       name: str\n       email: EmailStr\n\n   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):\n       \'\'\'\n       Schema for teacher response.\n       \'\'\'\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       email: str\n\n\n3. Implement CRUD Operations: In main.py, add endpoints for creating and reading teachers.\n   python\n   @app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)\n   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       \'\'\'\n       Create a new teacher in the database.\n       \'\'\'\n       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)\n       db.add(db_teacher)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_teacher)\n       return db_teacher\n\n   @app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])\n   def read_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       \'\'\'\n       Retrieve a list of teachers from the database.\n       \'\'\'\n       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()\n       return teachers\n\n\n4. Database Migration: Ensure that the database migration script is updated to include the new Teacher table without affecting existing Student and Course data.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer\'s requirements and adhere to the regulations set by ChatDev.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer\'s needs.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements specified by the customer. However, I have identified a critical area that needs attention:

### Comment with Highest Priority:
**Database Migration Handling:**
The current implementation does not include a migration script for the new `Teacher` table. While the `init_db` function checks for the existence of the database and applies migrations, it does not ensure that the `Teacher` table is created if it does not exist. This could lead to issues when the application is run for the first time or when the database schema is updated.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Add Alembic Migration Script:**
   You need to create a migration script using Alembic to handle the creation of the `Teacher` table. This script should be generated and applied to ensure that the database schema is updated correctly without losing existing data.

2. **Update `alembic.ini`:**
   Ensure that your `alembic.ini` file is correctly configured to point to your database and that the migration environment is set up properly.

3. **Run Alembic Commands:**
   After creating the migration script, run the following commands to apply the migration:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add Teacher table"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

4. **Verify Migration Logic:**
   Ensure that the migration logic in the generated script correctly handles the creation of the `Teacher` table without affecting existing `Student` and `Course` data.

5. **Test the Application:**
   After implementing the migration, thoroughly test the application to ensure that all functionalities, including creating and retrieving teachers, work as expected.

By addressing the migration handling, you will ensure that the application can be deployed smoothly without data loss or schema inconsistencies.

### Implementation Example:
Here is a brief example of what the migration script might look like:

```python
"""Add Teacher table

Revision ID: <your_revision_id>
Revises: <previous_revision_id>
Create Date: <date>
"""
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '<your_revision_id>'
down_revision = '<previous_revision_id>'
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String, nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String, nullable=False)
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('teachers')
```

Make sure to replace `<your_revision_id>` and `<previous_revision_id>` with the appropriate values.

By following these suggestions, you will ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements and functions correctly in all scenarios.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have assessed it against the regulations outlined. Here are the findings:

1) **All referenced classes should be imported**: All necessary classes are imported correctly in each file.

2) **All methods should be implemented**: All methods are implemented as required.

3) **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present and adequately describe the purpose of each method.

4) **No potential bugs**: The code appears to be free of syntax errors and logical bugs.

5) **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The implementation meets the requirements for creating a Teacher entity and updating the database schema.

6) **User interaction with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: The code allows for interaction with the Teacher entity through the FastAPI endpoints.

**Highest Priority Comment**: 
While the code is mostly correct, the `init_db` function in `database.py` does not explicitly handle the creation of the `teachers` table during the initial database setup. This could lead to issues if the database is created for the first time, as the `teachers` table would not exist, causing errors when trying to create or read teachers.

**Suggestions for Revision**:
To ensure that the `teachers` table is created when the database is initialized, modify the `init_db` function in `database.py` as follows:

```python
def init_db():
    '''
    Initialize the database and create tables.
    '''
    # Check if the database exists and apply migrations
    if os.path.exists("students.db"):
        alembic_cfg = AlembicConfig("alembic.ini")
        command.upgrade(alembic_cfg, "head")
    else:
        Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # This line creates all tables defined in the models
```

Make sure that the `Teacher` model is included in the `Base.metadata` so that it gets created when `create_all` is called.

By ensuring that the `teachers` table is created during the initial setup, you will prevent potential runtime errors when interacting with the Teacher entity.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Teacher Management System

A simple application for managing teachers, students, and courses using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.

## Main Functions

This application provides the following functionalities:

- **Create and Manage Teachers**: Add new teachers with their names and email addresses.
- **Create and Manage Students**: Add new students with their names, email addresses, and enroll them in courses.
- **Create and Manage Courses**: Add new courses with their names and levels.
- **Retrieve Lists**: Get lists of teachers, students, and courses.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/teacher-management-system.git
   cd teacher-management-system
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy pydantic alembic
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**:
   Ensure that the database is set up correctly by running the migrations:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## How to Use the Application

### Creating a Teacher

To create a new teacher, send a POST request to `/teachers/` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### Retrieving Teachers

To retrieve a list of teachers, send a GET request to `/teachers/`. You can also use query parameters `skip` and `limit` to paginate the results:

```
GET /teachers/?skip=0&limit=10
```

### Creating a Student

To create a new student, send a POST request to `/students/` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
  "course_ids": [1, 2]  // Optional: List of course IDs for enrollment
}
```

### Retrieving Students

To retrieve a list of students, send a GET request to `/students/`. You can also use query parameters `skip` and `limit` to paginate the results:

```
GET /students/?skip=0&limit=10
```

### Creating a Course

To create a new course, send a POST request to `/courses/` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "Mathematics",
  "level": "Beginner"
}
```

### Retrieving Courses

To retrieve a list of courses, send a GET request to `/courses/`. You can also use query parameters `skip` and `limit` to paginate the results:

```
GET /courses/?skip=0&limit=10
```
