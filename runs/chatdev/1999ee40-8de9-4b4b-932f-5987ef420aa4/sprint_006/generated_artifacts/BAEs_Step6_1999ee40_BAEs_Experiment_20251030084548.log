To address the customer's task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be a **Document** format, where we can provide detailed documentation on the changes made to the database schema, including the relationship between Course and Teacher entities. This would allow for clear explanations and could include diagrams if necessary.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Dashboard** that visualizes the relationships and allows users to interact with the data in real-time. This could be beneficial for users who want to see the relationships dynamically.

Another option is to use a **Mind Map** to visually represent the relationship between Courses and Teachers, which could help in brainstorming and understanding the connections.

What are your thoughts on these modalities? Do you have a preference or any other suggestions?

I appreciate your insights on the different modalities. 

A **Document** would provide a comprehensive overview of the changes, which is essential for clarity and future reference. It allows us to include technical details, migration steps, and explanations of the new relationship.

On the other hand, a **Dashboard** could offer a more interactive experience, allowing users to visualize the data and relationships in real-time. This could be particularly useful for stakeholders who want to see how the Course and Teacher entities interact dynamically.

The **Mind Map** is a great idea for brainstorming and visually organizing our thoughts, but it may not provide the depth of information needed for implementation and documentation.

Considering the requirements of the task and the need for clear communication with the customer, I lean towards the **Document** format. However, I see the value in the **Dashboard** as well.

What do you think? Should we prioritize detailed documentation or an interactive visualization?

I agree that the **Document** format would provide the necessary depth and clarity for the customer, especially since it allows us to include all technical details, migration steps, and explanations of the new relationship. This is crucial for ensuring that the customer fully understands the changes being made and can reference the document in the future.

While the **Dashboard** offers an interactive experience, it may not be as effective for conveying the comprehensive information required for this task. The primary goal here is to ensure that the customer has a clear understanding of the changes and how they will be implemented.

Given the importance of thorough documentation in this case, I believe we should prioritize the **Document** format. 

Are you in agreement with this approach? If so, we can finalize our decision.

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the requirements of the task. Here is my highest priority comment along with suggestions for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `Course` entity does not currently have a relationship defined with the `Teacher` entity. This is essential to fulfill the requirement that a `Course` should be able to have a teacher. Additionally, the database migration script does not include the necessary foreign key relationship to link the `Course` table to the `Teacher` table.

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Update the `Course` model** to include a foreign key relationship to the `Teacher` model. This can be done by adding a `teacher_id` column in the `Course` class and establishing a relationship.

2. **Modify the database migration script** to create the `teacher_id` column in the `courses` table and establish the foreign key constraint.

Here are the specific code changes:

#### Update `models.py`:
```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

#### Update `main.py` (Migration Script):
```python
def upgrade():
    '''
    Creates the Course table and creates the Teacher table.
    '''
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Create the courses table with teacher_id foreign key
        connection.execute(text('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                name TEXT NOT NULL,
                level TEXT NOT NULL,
                teacher_id INTEGER,
                FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers (id)
            )
        '''))
        # Create the teachers table
        connection.execute(text('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS teachers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL)'))
        # Create the association table for the many-to-many relationship
        connection.execute(text('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS student_courses (
                student_id INTEGER,
                course_id INTEGER,
                PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
                FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students (id),
                FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses (id)
            )
        '''))
```

### Conclusion:
Implementing these changes will ensure that the `Course` entity can have a relationship with the `Teacher` entity, thus fulfilling the customer's requirements. After making these adjustments, the code should be reviewed again to ensure all regulations are met.

Please proceed with these revisions to enhance the functionality of the application.

Implementing these changes will ensure that the `Course` entity can have a relationship with the `Teacher` entity, thus fulfilling the customer's requirements. After making these adjustments, the code should be reviewed again to ensure all regulations are met.

Please proceed with these revisions to enhance the functionality of the application.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the requirements of the task. Here is my highest priority comment along with suggestions for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `Course` entity does not currently have a relationship defined with the `Teacher` entity. This is essential to fulfill the requirement that a `Course` should be able to have a teacher. Additionally, the database migration script does not include the necessary foreign key relationship to link the `Course` table to the `Teacher` table.

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Update the `Course` model** to include a foreign key relationship to the `Teacher` model. This can be done by adding a `teacher_id` column in the `Course` class and establishing a relationship.

2. **Modify the database migration script** to create the `teacher_id` column in the `courses` table and establish the foreign key constraint.

Here are the specific code changes:

#### Update `models.py`:
```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

#### Update `main.py` (Migration Script):
```python
def upgrade():
    '''
    Creates the Course table and creates the Teacher table.
    '''
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Create the courses table with teacher_id foreign key
        connection.execute(text('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                name TEXT NOT NULL,
                level TEXT NOT NULL,
                teacher_id INTEGER,
                FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers (id)
            )
        '''))
        # Create the teachers table
        connection.execute(text('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS teachers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL)'))
        # Create the association table for the many-to-many relationship
        connection.execute(text('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS student_courses (
                student_id INTEGER,
                course_id INTEGER,
                PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
                FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students (id),
                FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses (id)
            )
        '''))
```

### Conclusion:
Implementing these changes will ensure that the `Course` entity can have a relationship with the `Teacher` entity, thus fulfilling the customer's requirements. After making these adjustments, the code should be reviewed again to ensure all regulations are met.

Please proceed with these revisions to enhance the functionality of the application."

Here is my highest priority comment along with suggestions for revision:\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe Course entity does not currently have a relationship defined with the Teacher entity. This is essential to fulfill the requirement that a Course should be able to have a teacher. Additionally, the database migration script does not include the necessary foreign key relationship to link the Course table to the Teacher table.\n\n### Suggested Revisions:\n1. Update the Course model to include a foreign key relationship to the Teacher model. This can be done by adding a teacher_id column in the Course class and establishing a relationship.\n\n2. Modify the database migration script to create the teacher_id column in the courses table and establish the foreign key constraint.\n\nHere are the specific code changes:\n\n#### Update models.py:\npython\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = "courses"\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\'teachers.id\'))  # Add this line\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n    teacher = relationship("Teacher")  # Add this line to establish the relationship\n\n\n#### Update main.py (Migration Script):\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    \'\'\'\n    Creates the Course table and creates the Teacher table.\n    \'\'\'\n    with engine.connect() as connection:\n        # Create the courses table with teacher_id foreign key\n        connection.execute(text(\'\'\'\n            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (\n                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n                name TEXT NOT NULL,\n                level TEXT NOT NULL,\n                teacher_id INTEGER,\n                FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers (id)\n            )\n        \'\'\'))\n        # Create the teachers table\n        connection.execute(text(\'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS teachers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL)\'))\n        # Create the association table for the many-to-many relationship\n        connection.execute(text(\'\'\'\n            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS student_courses (\n                student_id INTEGER,\n                course_id INTEGER,\n                PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),\n                FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students (id),\n                FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses (id)\n            )\n        \'\'\'))\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nImplementing these changes will ensure that the Course entity can have a relationship with the Teacher entity, thus fulfilling the customer\'s requirements. After making these adjustments, the code should be reviewed again to ensure all regulations are met.\n\nPlease proceed with these revisions to enhance the functionality of the application.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The `upgrade` function in `main.py` does not handle the migration of existing data from the `courses` table to accommodate the new `teacher_id` foreign key. This could lead to data integrity issues if the existing `courses` table already contains data without a corresponding `teacher_id`. 

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade` function** to include logic that ensures existing data is preserved and correctly migrated to the new schema. This may involve:
   - Adding a default value for `teacher_id` in the `courses` table during the migration.
   - Ensuring that if there are existing courses, they can be updated to include a valid `teacher_id` or set to `NULL` if no teacher is assigned.

Here’s an example of how you might modify the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    '''
    Creates the Course table and creates the Teacher table.
    '''
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Create the teachers table

### Additional Considerations:
- Ensure that the `downgrade` function is properly implemented to handle the removal of the `teacher_id` column if necessary in the future.
- Review the `init_db` function to ensure it does not recreate tables that already exist, which could lead to data loss.

By addressing these points, you will ensure that the software remains operable and meets the customer's requirements without losing any existing features or data integrity.

If you implement these changes, please re-run the tests to confirm that everything works as expected.

[2025-30-10 08:46:58 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The `upgrade` function in `main.py` does not handle the migration of existing data from the `courses` table to accommodate the new `teacher_id` foreign key. This could lead to data integrity issues if the existing `courses` table already contains data without a corresponding `teacher_id`. 

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade` function** to include logic that ensures existing data is preserved and correctly migrated to the new schema. This may involve:
   - Adding a default value for `teacher_id` in the `courses` table during the migration.
   - Ensuring that if there are existing courses, they can be updated to include a valid `teacher_id` or set to `NULL` if no teacher is assigned.

Here’s an example of how you might modify the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    '''
    Creates the Course table and creates the Teacher table.
    '''
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Create the teachers table
        connection.execute(text('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS teachers (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                name TEXT NOT NULL,
                email TEXT NOT NULL
            )
        '''))
        
        # Create the courses table with teacher_id foreign key
        connection.execute(text('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                name TEXT NOT NULL,
                level TEXT NOT NULL,
                teacher_id INTEGER,
                FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers (id)
            )
        '''))
        
        # Create the association table for the many-to-many relationship
        connection.execute(text('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS student_courses (
                student_id INTEGER,
                course_id INTEGER,
                PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
                FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students (id),
                FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses (id)
            )
        '''))
        
        # If the courses table already exists, we should ensure that it is updated correctly
        # This part is pseudo-code and should be implemented according to your specific logic
        # connection.execute(text('UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = NULL WHERE teacher_id IS NOT NULL'))
```

### Additional Considerations:
- Ensure that the `downgrade` function is properly implemented to handle the removal of the `teacher_id` column if necessary in the future.
- Review the `init_db` function to ensure it does not recreate tables that already exist, which could lead to data loss.

By addressing these points, you will ensure that the software remains operable and meets the customer's requirements without losing any existing features or data integrity.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration process that could lead to data loss or inconsistency. Here’s the highest priority comment and suggestion for revision:

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The `upgrade` function in `main.py` creates the `courses` and `teachers` tables without checking if they already exist or if they need to be altered. This could lead to issues if the tables already exist, especially if they have been modified or if the migration is run multiple times. Additionally, the `downgrade` function is incomplete and does not provide a way to revert changes effectively.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Modify the `upgrade` function** to check for existing tables and alter them if necessary, rather than creating new ones blindly. You may want to use SQLAlchemy's migration tools (like Alembic) for a more robust solution.
2. **Complete the `downgrade` function** to allow for proper rollback of changes. If you need to drop tables or columns, ensure that the logic is in place to handle this safely.
3. **Ensure that existing data is preserved** during migrations by using `ALTER TABLE` statements instead of `CREATE TABLE` when modifying existing structures.

Here’s a revised version of the `upgrade` function that incorporates these suggestions:

```python
def upgrade():
    '''
    Creates the Course table and creates the Teacher table if they do not exist.
    '''
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Check if the teachers table exists, if not create it
        connection.execute(text('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS teachers (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                name TEXT NOT NULL,
                email TEXT NOT NULL
            )
        '''))
        
        # Check if the courses table exists, if not create it
        connection.execute(text('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                name TEXT NOT NULL,
                level TEXT NOT NULL,
                teacher_id INTEGER,
                FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers (id)
            )
        '''))
```

Make sure to implement similar checks for the `downgrade` function if you plan to drop tables or columns.

By addressing these issues, you will ensure that the software operates correctly and maintains data integrity throughout the migration process.

**Final Note:** Consider using a migration tool like Alembic for handling database schema changes more effectively, as it provides a structured way to manage migrations and rollbacks.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the typical dependencies for a Python project that uses SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
# Required packages for the project
sqlalchemy==1.4.27          # SQLAlchemy for ORM and database interactions
pydantic==1.9.0             # Pydantic for data validation and settings management
sqlite3                      # SQLite for database management (included with Python standard library)
```

This `requirements.txt` file specifies the necessary packages for the project to function correctly, including specific versions for compatibility. Note that `sqlite3` is part of the Python standard library, so it does not need to be installed separately, but it's included here for clarity. If you are using a different database, you may need to add the appropriate database driver as well.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the typical dependencies for a Python project that uses SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file:

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# ChatDev Course Management System

Welcome to the ChatDev Course Management System! This software allows you to manage courses, students, and teachers effectively. With the recent updates, you can now establish relationships between courses and teachers, enhancing the functionality of the application.

## Main Functions

- **Manage Courses**: Create, read, update, and delete courses.
- **Manage Students**: Create, read, update, and delete student records.
- **Manage Teachers**: Create, read, update, and delete teacher records.
- **Course-Teacher Relationship**: Each course can now have an associated teacher, allowing for better organization and management of educational resources.

## Installation

To get started with the ChatDev Course Management System, you'll need to install the necessary environment dependencies. Follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatdev-course-management.git
   cd chatdev-course-management
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   sqlalchemy
   pydantic
   ```

4. **Initialize the Database**:
   Run the following command to create the necessary database tables:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

### Starting the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application by executing:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

### Managing Entities

- **Adding a Teacher**:
  - Use the GUI to input teacher details (name and email).
  
- **Adding a Course**:
  - Input course details (name, level) and select a teacher from the dropdown list to associate with the course.

- **Adding a Student**:
  - Input student details (name and email) and assign courses as needed.

### Viewing Relationships

- Each course will display its associated teacher, and each teacher can be linked to multiple courses.
- You can view all students enrolled in a course and all courses taught by a teacher.

## Database Migration

The database schema has been updated to include the new relationship between courses and teachers. Existing data for students, courses, and teachers will be preserved during migration.

### Upgrade and Downgrade Functions

- The `upgrade()` function in `main.py` creates the necessary tables and relationships.
- The `downgrade()` function is currently not implemented due to SQLite limitations on dropping columns.

## Documentation

For more detailed documentation and examples, please refer to the following resources:

- [SQLAlchemy Documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/)
- [Pydantic Documentation](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)
