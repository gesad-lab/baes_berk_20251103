To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. Given the simplicity of the data structure (name and level fields), I believe a straightforward approach would be beneficial. 

A Document format could be useful for outlining the Course entity specifications and requirements. However, if we want to provide a more interactive experience, a Dashboard could visualize the Course data effectively, especially if we plan to expand on this in the future.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the Document and Dashboard formats. While a Document would provide a clear outline of the Course entity specifications, I think a Dashboard could offer a more dynamic way to visualize and interact with the Course data, especially if we anticipate future enhancements or additional features related to courses.

Moreover, a Dashboard could allow for real-time updates and visual representation of the Course data, which could be beneficial for users who need to manage or analyze this information regularly.

That said, if we want to keep things simple and focused solely on the Course entity for now, a Document might suffice. However, I lean towards the Dashboard for its potential to grow with the project.

What do you think? Should we prioritize interactivity with a Dashboard, or keep it straightforward with a Document?

I understand your perspective on the Dashboard's potential for interactivity and future enhancements. It certainly offers a more engaging way to visualize the Course data, which could be appealing for users who want to manage and analyze their courses dynamically.

However, considering the current task's simplicity and the immediate need to create the Course entity, a Document might be the more pragmatic choice. It allows us to clearly define the specifications without overcomplicating the initial implementation. 

That said, if we foresee a need for ongoing interaction and updates, we could plan to transition to a Dashboard in the future once the Course entity is established.

Ultimately, I think we should weigh the immediate requirements against future scalability. What do you think about prioritizing the Dashboard while keeping the Document as a supplementary option for clarity?

I see the merit in your suggestion to prioritize the Dashboard while also providing a Document as a supplementary option. This approach allows us to address the immediate task of creating the Course entity with a clear specification in the Document, while also setting the stage for a more interactive and engaging experience through the Dashboard.

By implementing the Dashboard, we can ensure that users have a dynamic way to visualize and manage their Course data, which aligns with our goal of enhancing user experience and adaptability for future needs.

Therefore, I agree that we can move forward with the Dashboard as our primary product modality, with the Document serving as a supporting resource for clarity and specification.

Let's finalize our decision.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has several areas that need to be addressed to meet the customer's requirements and the regulations set by ChatDev. Below is a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model is not defined or imported in `models.py`. This is critical as the task requires creating a `Course` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There is no method for creating the `Course` table or handling the migration for it in `main.py`. This needs to be added.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - While some methods have comments, the new methods that need to be added for the `Course` entity will also need appropriate comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The current code does not have any apparent bugs, but the lack of the `Course` model and migration logic could lead to runtime errors when trying to access the `Course` entity.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project does not currently conform to the user's task as the `Course` entity is not implemented.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - Without the `Course` entity and its associated logic, users will not be able to interact with the `Course` data as required.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the `Course` entity is not defined or implemented in the codebase, which directly violates the customer's requirement to create a `Course` entity with `name` and `level` fields.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Course Model**: Add a new `Course` class in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       '''
       Course model representing the courses table in the database.
       '''
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Update the Database Migration Logic**: Modify `main.py` to include a method for creating the `Course` table:
   ```python
   def create_course_table():
       '''
       Create the courses table in the database.
       '''
       Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)
   ```

3. **Call the new method in the main execution block**:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       create_tables()  # Ensure tables are created before altering them
       add_email_column()
       create_course_table()  # Ensure the Course table is created
   ```

4. **Update the schemas.py**: Add Pydantic schemas for the `Course` entity:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for creating a new course.
       '''
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for returning course data.
       '''
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str
       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer's requirements and adhere to the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the `Course` entity is properly created and integrated into the application.

       create_tables()  # Ensure tables are created before altering them
       add_email_column()
       create_course_table()  # Ensure the Course table is created
   ```

   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):

       level: str

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has several areas that need to be addressed to meet the customer's requirements and the regulations set by ChatDev. Below is a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model is not defined or imported in `models.py`. This is critical as the task requires creating a `Course` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There is no method for creating the `Course` table or handling the migration for it in `main.py`. This needs to be added.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - While some methods have comments, the new methods that need to be added for the `Course` entity will also need appropriate comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The current code does not have any apparent bugs, but the lack of the `Course` model and migration logic could lead to runtime errors when trying to access the `Course` entity.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project does not currently conform to the user's task as the `Course` entity is not implemented.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - Without the `Course` entity and its associated logic, users will not be able to interact with the `Course` data as required.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the `Course` entity is not defined or implemented in the codebase, which directly violates the customer's requirement to create a `Course` entity with `name` and `level` fields.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Course Model**: Add a new `Course` class in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       '''
       Course model representing the courses table in the database.
       '''
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Update the Database Migration Logic**: Modify `main.py` to include a method for creating the `Course` table:
   ```python
   def create_course_table():
       '''
       Create the courses table in the database.
       '''
       Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)
   ```

3. **Call the new method in the main execution block**:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       create_tables()  # Ensure tables are created before altering them
       add_email_column()
       create_course_table()  # Ensure the Course table is created
   ```

4. **Update the schemas.py**: Add Pydantic schemas for the `Course` entity:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for creating a new course.
       '''
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       '''
       Schema for returning course data.
       '''
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str
       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer's requirements and adhere to the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the `Course` entity is properly created and integrated into the application."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

This revised code now includes the `Course` entity with the required fields, updates the database schema accordingly, and ensures that existing `Student` data is preserved during migration. Each file follows the specified markdown code block format.

Below is a detailed review based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - The Course model is not defined or imported in models.py. This is critical as the task requires creating a Course entity.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - There is no method for creating the Course table or handling the migration for it in main.py. This needs to be added.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - While some methods have comments, the new methods that need to be added for the Course entity will also need appropriate comments.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The current code does not have any apparent bugs, but the lack of the Course model and migration logic could lead to runtime errors when trying to access the Course entity.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The project does not currently conform to the user\'s task as the Course entity is not implemented.\n\n6. User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - Without the Course entity and its associated logic, users will not be able to interact with the Course data as required.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is that the Course entity is not defined or implemented in the codebase, which directly violates the customer\'s requirement to create a Course entity with name and level fields.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Define the Course Model: Add a new Course class in models.py:\n   python\n   class Course(Base):\n       \'\'\'\n       Course model representing the courses table in the database.\n       \'\'\'\n       __tablename__ = "courses"\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Update the Database Migration Logic: Modify main.py to include a method for creating the Course table:\n   python\n   def create_course_table():\n       \'\'\'\n       Create the courses table in the database.\n       \'\'\'\n       Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)\n\n\n3. Call the new method in the main execution block:\n   python\n   if __name__ == "__main__":\n       create_tables()  # Ensure tables are created before altering them\n       add_email_column()\n       create_course_table()  # Ensure the Course table is created\n\n\n4. Update the schemas.py: Add Pydantic schemas for the Course entity:\n   python\n   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n       \'\'\'\n       Schema for creating a new course.\n       \'\'\'\n       name: str\n       level: str\n\n   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):\n       \'\'\'\n       Schema for returning course data.\n       \'\'\'\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       level: str\n       class Config:\n           orm_mode = True\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer\'s requirements and adhere to the regulations set by ChatDev.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease implement the suggested changes to ensure the Course entity is properly created and integrated into the application.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few areas that need attention to ensure it meets the regulations set by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The imports in `main.py` are sufficient for the current functionality.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented correctly.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present and adequately describe the purpose of each method.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors, but there is a potential issue with the `add_email_column` method. The default value for the new column is set to an empty string, which may not be appropriate if the email is required. This could lead to data integrity issues.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project meets the requirements of creating a `Course` entity and updating the database schema.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The migration script does not explicitly handle existing data in the `students` table when adding the `email` column. If the column is required, existing records will not comply with the new schema.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
The highest priority issue is related to the `add_email_column` method. Since the `email` field is required, the default value of an empty string could lead to data integrity issues. Instead, you should allow the column to be nullable initially and then enforce the requirement through application logic or a separate migration.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Modify the `add_email_column` method** to allow the `email` column to be nullable initially:
   ```python
   def add_email_column():
       '''
       Add the email column to the students table if it does not already exist.
       '''
       with engine.connect() as connection:
           # Check if the column already exists
           result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students);"))
           columns = [row[1] for row in result]
           if "email" not in columns:
               connection.execute(text("ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT;"))  # Allow null initially
   ```

2. **Consider implementing a separate migration** to update existing records with valid email addresses after the column has been added, or enforce email validation in the application logic.

By addressing this issue, you will ensure that the application maintains data integrity and complies with the requirements set forth by the user.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `add_email_column` method in `main.py` is designed to add an email column to the existing Student table. However, the current implementation does not handle the migration of existing Student data properly. Specifically, if the email column is added with a default value of an empty string, it may lead to data integrity issues if the application later requires a valid email for all students.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Modify the `add_email_column` Method**: Instead of adding the email column with a default empty string, consider allowing the column to be nullable initially. This way, existing records won't be forced to have an invalid email. You can then implement a separate migration script to update existing records with valid emails if necessary.

2. **Update the `add_email_column` Method**:
   ```python
   def add_email_column():
       '''
       Add the email column to the students table if it does not already exist.
       '''
       with engine.connect() as connection:
           # Check if the column already exists
           result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students);"))
           columns = [row[1] for row in result]
           if "email" not in columns:
               connection.execute(text("ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT;"))  # Allow null values initially
   ```

3. **Consider Data Migration**: If you have existing student records, you may want to implement a data migration strategy to populate the email field for existing records later on.

By making these adjustments, you will ensure that the application adheres to best practices regarding database migrations and data integrity.

### Final Note:
After implementing the suggested changes, please re-run the application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected and that the database schema is correctly updated without losing any existing data.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the typical dependencies required for a Python project that uses SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
# Required packages for the ChatDev application

# SQLAlchemy for database interaction
SQLAlchemy==1.4.27

# Pydantic for data validation and settings management
pydantic==1.8.2

# SQLite support (included with Python, but specifying for clarity)
sqlite3

# FastAPI for building the API (if needed in the future)
fastapi==0.68.1

# Uvicorn for serving the FastAPI application (if needed in the future)
uvicorn==0.15.0
```

### Explanation:
- **SQLAlchemy**: This is the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used in your project for database interactions.
- **Pydantic**: This is used for data validation and serialization in your application.
- **sqlite3**: This is included with Python by default, but it's mentioned here for clarity since you're using SQLite as your database.
- **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn**: These are included as optional dependencies if you plan to build a web API around your application in the future.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project's compatibility and requirements.

 <INFO> Based on the provided code and the typical dependencies required for a Python project that uses SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
# Required packages for the ChatDev application
# SQLAlchemy for database interaction
SQLAlchemy==1.4.27
# Pydantic for data validation and settings management
pydantic==1.8.2
# SQLite support (included with Python, but specifying for clarity)
sqlite3
# FastAPI for building the API (if needed in the future)
fastapi==0.68.1
# Uvicorn for serving the FastAPI application (if needed in the future)
uvicorn==0.15.0
```

### Explanation:
- **SQLAlchemy**: This is the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used in your project for database interactions.
- **Pydantic**: This is used for data validation and serialization in your application.
- **sqlite3**: This is included with Python by default, but it's mentioned here for clarity since you're using SQLite as your database.
- **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn**: These are included as optional dependencies if you plan to build a web API around your application in the future.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project's compatibility and requirements.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

```markdown
# ChatDev

Changing the digital world through programming

ChatDev is a software application designed to manage students and courses efficiently. It allows users to create and manage student records and course entities with ease.

## Main Functions

- **Student Management**: Create, read, update, and delete student records.
- **Course Management**: Create and manage courses with specific attributes such as name and level.
- **Database Migration**: Automatically updates the database schema to include new entities while preserving existing data.

## Quick Install

To set up the ChatDev application, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using `pip`:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy pydantic
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatdev.git
   cd chatdev
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: 
   To start the application, run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a Course

To create a new course, you can use the following schema:

```python
from schemas import CourseCreate
course_data = CourseCreate(name="Mathematics", level="Beginner")
```

### Database Migration

When you run the application, it will automatically create the necessary tables in the SQLite database (`students.db`). The migration process will ensure that existing student data is preserved while adding the new `Course` table.

### Accessing the GUI

The graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented in `gui.py`. You can modify this file to create a user-friendly interface for managing students and courses.

## Documentation

For more detailed information on how to use the ChatDev application, please refer to the following sections:

- **Getting Started**: Installation, setting up the environment, and simple examples.
- **How-To Examples**: Demos, integrations, and helper functions.
- **Reference**: Full API documentation.
