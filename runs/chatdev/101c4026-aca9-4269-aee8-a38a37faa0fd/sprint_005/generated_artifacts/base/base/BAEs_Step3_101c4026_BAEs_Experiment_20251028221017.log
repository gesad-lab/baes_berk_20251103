To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we need to consider the best product modality that can effectively present the information regarding the Course entity, including its name and level fields. 

Given the nature of the task, I believe a Database or Application modality could be suitable, as it allows for the creation and management of entities like Course. However, we should also consider if a Dashboard could be beneficial for visualizing the Course data in a more interactive way.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I agree that a Database or Application modality would be effective for managing the Course entity, as it allows for direct interaction with the data structure. However, I also see the value in a Dashboard for visualizing the Course data, especially if we want to provide insights or analytics related to the courses.

Ultimately, if the primary focus is on creating and managing the Course entity, I lean towards the Application modality, as it can provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Course data. 

What do you think about prioritizing the Application modality for this task?

I agree with your assessment. Prioritizing the Application modality makes sense, as it allows us to create a user-friendly interface for managing the Course entity effectively. This approach will enable users to easily input and interact with the Course data, ensuring that the requirements are met while providing a seamless experience.

While the Dashboard could offer valuable insights, the primary goal here is to create and manage the Course entity, which aligns well with the capabilities of an Application. 

If we are in agreement on this, we can finalize our decision.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Code Review

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is essential for the implementation of the Course entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There are no CRUD operations for the Course entity. We need to implement these methods in `api.py`.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present in the Student API methods, but similar comments need to be added for the Course methods once implemented.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code for the Student entity appears to be free of bugs, but without the Course entity, we cannot ensure the overall integrity of the application.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The current implementation does not conform to the user's request as the Course entity is missing.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - Since the Course entity is not implemented, the user cannot interact with it as required.

### Highest Priority Comment
The most critical issue is the absence of the Course entity and its corresponding CRUD operations. This directly violates the user's requirement to create a Course entity with `name` and `level` fields.

### Suggestions for Revision
1. **Define the Course Model**: Create a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Course Schema**: Add a new schema for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement CRUD Operations for Course**: Add the following methods in `api.py`:
   ```python
   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
   def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return courses

   @router.get("/courses/{course_id}", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def get_course(course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
       if course is None:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Course not found")
       return course

   @router.put("/courses/{course_id}", response_model=dict)
   def update_course(course_id: int, course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
       if db_course is None:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Course not found")
       db_course.name = course.name
       db_course.level = course.level
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return {"detail": "Course updated successfully", "course": db_course}

   @router.delete("/courses/{course_id}")
   def delete_course(course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
       if db_course is None:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Course not found")
       db.delete(db_course)
       db.commit()
       return {"detail": "Course deleted successfully"}
   ```

4. **Update Migration Script**: Create a new migration script to add the Course table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'courses',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
   ```

5. **Run the Migration**: Ensure to run the migration to update the database schema.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements and allow interaction with the Course entity.

### Final Instruction
Please proceed with the above revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the user's needs.

### Highest Priority Comment
The most critical issue is the absence of the Course entity and its corresponding CRUD operations. This directly violates the user's requirement to create a Course entity with `name` and `level` fields.

### Suggestions for Revision
1. **Define the Course Model**: Create a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Course Schema**: Add a new schema for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement CRUD Operations for Course**: Add the following methods in `api.py`:
   ```python

       db.delete(db_course)
       db.commit()
       return {"detail": "Course deleted successfully"}
   ```

4. **Update Migration Script**: Create a new migration script to add the Course table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'courses',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
   ```

5. **Run the Migration**: Ensure to run the migration to update the database schema.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements and allow interaction with the Course entity.

### Final Instruction
Please proceed with the above revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the user's needs.

Comments on Codes:
"### Code Review

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is essential for the implementation of the Course entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There are no CRUD operations for the Course entity. We need to implement these methods in `api.py`.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present in the Student API methods, but similar comments need to be added for the Course methods once implemented.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code for the Student entity appears to be free of bugs, but without the Course entity, we cannot ensure the overall integrity of the application.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The current implementation does not conform to the user's request as the Course entity is missing.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - Since the Course entity is not implemented, the user cannot interact with it as required.

### Highest Priority Comment
The most critical issue is the absence of the Course entity and its corresponding CRUD operations. This directly violates the user's requirement to create a Course entity with `name` and `level` fields.

### Suggestions for Revision
1. **Define the Course Model**: Create a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Course Schema**: Add a new schema for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement CRUD Operations for Course**: Add the following methods in `api.py`:
   ```python

   ```

4. **Update Migration Script**: Create a new migration script to add the Course table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'courses',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
   ```

5. **Run the Migration**: Ensure to run the migration to update the database schema.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements and allow interaction with the Course entity.

### Final Instruction
Please proceed with the above revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the user's needs."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the updated codes with the necessary modifications to implement the Course entity as per the user's requirements. Each file is formatted according to the specified markdown code block format.

All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - The Course model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is essential for the implementation of the Course entity.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - There are no CRUD operations for the Course entity. We need to implement these methods in api.py.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - Comments are present in the Student API methods, but similar comments need to be added for the Course methods once implemented.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The existing code for the Student entity appears to be free of bugs, but without the Course entity, we cannot ensure the overall integrity of the application.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The current implementation does not conform to the user\'s request as the Course entity is missing.\n\n6. User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - Since the Course entity is not implemented, the user cannot interact with it as required.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment\nThe most critical issue is the absence of the Course entity and its corresponding CRUD operations. This directly violates the user\'s requirement to create a Course entity with name and level fields.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision\n1. Define the Course Model: Create a new model for the Course entity in models.py:\n   python\n   from sqlalchemy import Column, String\n   class Course(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Create Course Schema: Add a new schema for the Course entity in schemas.py:\n   python\n   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       level: str\n\n   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       level: str\n\n       class Config:\n           orm_mode = True\n\n\n3. Implement CRUD Operations for Course: Add the following methods in api.py:\n   python\n   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)\n   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)\n       db.add(db_course)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_course)\n       return db_course\n\n   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseResponse])\n   def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()\n       return courses\n\n   @router.get("/courses/{course_id}", response_model=CourseResponse)\n   def get_course(course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n       if course is None:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Course not found")\n       return course\n\n   @router.put("/courses/{course_id}", response_model=dict)\n   def update_course(course_id: int, course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n       if db_course is None:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Course not found")\n       db_course.name = course.name\n       db_course.level = course.level\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_course)\n       return {"detail": "Course updated successfully", "course": db_course}\n\n   @router.delete("/courses/{course_id}")\n   def delete_course(course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n       if db_course is None:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Course not found")\n       db.delete(db_course)\n       db.commit()\n       return {"detail": "Course deleted successfully"}\n\n\n4. Update Migration Script: Create a new migration script to add the Course table:\n   python\n   def upgrade():\n       op.create_table(\n           \'courses\',\n           sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n           sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n           sa.Column(\'level\', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n       )\n\n\n5. Run the Migration: Ensure to run the migration to update the database schema.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the user\'s requirements and allow interaction with the Course entity.\n\n### Final Instruction\nPlease proceed with the above revisions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the user\'s needs.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the task requirements. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
1. **Migration Script Revision ID**: The migration script (`migration_script.py`) contains a placeholder for the revision ID (`revision = 'xxxxxx'`). This needs to be updated with a valid revision ID to ensure that Alembic can track the migration properly.

### Suggestions for Revision:
- Update the `revision` variable in `migration_script.py` with a unique identifier (e.g., a timestamp or a sequential number). For example:
  ```python
  revision = '20231001_001'  # Example revision ID
  ```

### Additional Comments:
- Ensure that the `down_revision` variable is set to the last migration ID to maintain the migration history.
- Verify that the database schema is created correctly and that the migration script is executed after the initial setup to avoid any conflicts.

### Instructions:
1. Open `migration_script.py`.
2. Replace the line `revision = 'xxxxxx'` with a valid revision ID.
3. Ensure that `down_revision` is set to the correct previous migration ID.

By addressing this issue, the migration will function correctly, allowing for the addition of the Course table while preserving existing Student data.

If you implement this change, the code will be compliant with the requirements and ready for deployment.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have assessed it against the regulations outlined. Here are my findings:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: All necessary classes are imported correctly in `api.py`, `schemas.py`, `database.py`, `models.py`, and `migration_script.py`.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: All CRUD methods for both `Student` and `Course` entities are implemented.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present, but they could be more descriptive in some areas, particularly in the CRUD operations for clarity.

4. **No potential bugs**: The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The code meets the requirements of creating a `Course` entity with the specified fields and includes the necessary CRUD operations.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The code allows for interaction with both `Student` and `Course` entities without losing any features.

**Highest Priority Comment**: The migration script (`migration_script.py`) does not include a proper `down_revision` value. This is crucial for Alembic to manage migrations correctly. If the `down_revision` is set to `None`, it indicates that this is the first migration, which may not be accurate if there are existing migrations.

**Suggestions for Revision**:
- Update the `down_revision` in `migration_script.py` to the correct previous revision ID if there are existing migrations. If this is indeed the first migration, ensure that the database is initialized properly before running this migration.

Here is the revised section of the migration script:

```python
# migration_script.py
# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = 'xxxxxx'  # Replace with your revision ID
down_revision = 'previous_revision_id'  # Replace with the actual previous revision ID
```

If this is the first migration, ensure that the database is set up correctly and that this migration is the first one applied.

Overall, the code is well-structured and meets the requirements, but addressing the migration script's `down_revision` is essential for proper database management.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers if you want to use specific versions or if there are newer versions available. You can install these dependencies using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
Make sure to adjust the version numbers if you want to use specific versions or if there are newer versions available. You can install these dependencies using the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
