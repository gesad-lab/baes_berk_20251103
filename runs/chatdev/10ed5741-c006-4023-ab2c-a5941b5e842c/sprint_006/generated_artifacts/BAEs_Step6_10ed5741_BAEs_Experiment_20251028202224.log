To address the customer's requirement of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be a **Document** format, where we can provide detailed documentation of the changes made to the database schema, including the relationship between Course and Teacher entities. This would allow for clear explanations and visual representations if needed.

Alternatively, a **Dashboard** could be beneficial, as it would allow users to visualize the relationships between Courses and Teachers in real-time, making it easier to manage and understand the data.

Lastly, we could consider a **Website** format, which could serve as an interactive platform to showcase the new features and relationships, providing users with an engaging experience.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the product modalities. 

A **Document** format would indeed provide a comprehensive overview of the changes and the rationale behind them, which is essential for clarity and future reference. 

On the other hand, a **Dashboard** could offer a dynamic way to visualize the relationships and manage the data effectively, which could be very useful for users who prefer interactive tools.

The **Website** option would allow for a more engaging presentation, but it may not provide the depth of information that a Document would or the interactivity of a Dashboard.

Considering the customer's needs for clarity and potential future use, I lean towards the **Document** format for detailed documentation, but I see the value in the Dashboard as well.

What do you think? Should we prioritize clarity with a Document or interactivity with a Dashboard?

I understand your perspective on prioritizing clarity with a Document, as it would provide a thorough explanation of the changes and serve as a valuable reference for the customer. The Document format would ensure that all technical details are well-documented, which is crucial for understanding the new relationship between Course and Teacher entities.

However, the interactivity offered by a Dashboard could enhance user experience by allowing them to visualize and manage the data dynamically, which could be particularly beneficial for ongoing use and engagement.

Given the importance of both clarity and interactivity, I propose that we lean towards the **Document** format for the initial delivery, ensuring that all necessary details are captured. We could also consider developing a Dashboard as a subsequent enhancement to provide that interactive experience later on.

What do you think about this approach? Shall we finalize on the Document format?

I agree with your proposal to prioritize the **Document** format for the initial delivery. This will ensure that we provide the customer with a comprehensive and clear understanding of the changes made to the database schema and the new relationship between Course and Teacher entities. 

We can certainly consider developing a Dashboard as a future enhancement to provide interactivity and dynamic data management, but starting with a well-documented approach will lay a solid foundation.

Let's finalize our decision on the Document format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided does not fully implement the requirement of adding a relationship from the Course entity to the Teacher entity. Here are the detailed checks based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The necessary classes are imported in `api.py` and `models.py`.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The methods for creating and retrieving teachers are implemented in `api.py`. However, there is no method to associate a Course with a Teacher.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present for the methods in `api.py`, but the new relationship methods need to be added.

4. **No potential bugs**: The code appears to be free of syntax errors, but the logic for associating a Course with a Teacher is missing.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The task of adding a relationship from Course to Teacher is not yet fulfilled.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation does not allow users to assign a teacher to a course.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the relationship between the Course and Teacher entities has not been implemented. You need to add a foreign key in the Course model to reference the Teacher entity and update the database migration accordingly.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py`** to include a foreign key relationship in the Course model:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
       students = relationship('Student', secondary=student_courses, back_populates='courses')
       teacher = relationship('Teacher', back_populates='courses')  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model** to include the reverse relationship:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship('Course', back_populates='teacher')  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `migration.py`** to include the new foreign key in the Course table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       # Create the Teacher table
       op.create_table('teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
       # Add teacher_id column to courses table
       op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id')))
   ```

4. **Update the API to handle assigning a teacher to a course**. You may want to add an endpoint to update a course with a teacher ID.

By implementing these changes, you will fulfill the requirement of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, allowing for proper interaction and data integrity.

### Final Note:
Make sure to run the migration after making these changes to ensure the database schema is updated correctly.

       courses = relationship('Course', back_populates='teacher')  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `migration.py`** to include the new foreign key in the Course table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       # Create the Teacher table
       op.create_table('teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
       # Add teacher_id column to courses table
       op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id')))
   ```

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes according to the customer's task and requirements, formatted as requested:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The migration script `migration.py` does not include a step to preserve existing data when adding the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table. This could lead to data loss or integrity issues if there are existing courses in the database.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade()` function in `migration.py` to include a step that ensures existing data is preserved when adding the `teacher_id` column.** This can be done by setting the `teacher_id` column to `NULL` for existing records, which is already handled since the column is nullable. However, it is essential to ensure that the migration does not disrupt existing relationships or data integrity.

2. **Ensure that the migration script is executed after the initial database setup to avoid conflicts.** 

Here’s an example of how you might adjust the migration script:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the Teacher table
    op.create_table('teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Add teacher_id to courses
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))
    # Optional: If you want to set a default value or handle existing records, you can add logic here
    # For example, setting teacher_id to NULL for existing courses is already handled by nullable=True
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- **Ensure that the `create_database()` function in `database.py` is called before running the migrations to create the initial tables.**
- **Consider adding validation in the API endpoints to check if the `teacher_id` provided in the `CourseCreate` model corresponds to an existing teacher. This will prevent errors when trying to associate a course with a non-existent teacher.**

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the software meets the user's requirements and operates without issues. 

If you need further assistance or clarification on any of these points, feel free to ask!

This could lead to data loss or integrity issues if there are existing courses in the database.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Modify the upgrade() function in migration.py to include a step that ensures existing data is preserved when adding the teacher_id column. This can be done by setting the teacher_id column to NULL for existing records, which is already handled since the column is nullable. However, it is essential to ensure that the migration does not disrupt existing relationships or data integrity.\n\n2. Ensure that the migration script is executed after the initial database setup to avoid conflicts. \n\nHere’s an example of how you might adjust the migration script:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Create the Teacher table\n    op.create_table('teachers',\n        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n    )\n    # Add teacher_id to courses\n    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))\n    # Optional: If you want to set a default value or handle existing records, you can add logic here\n    # For example, setting teacher_id to NULL for existing courses is already handled by nullable=True\n\n\n### Additional Suggestions:\n- Ensure that the create_database() function in database.py is called before running the migrations to create the initial tables.\n- Consider adding validation in the API endpoints to check if the teacher_id provided in the CourseCreate model corresponds to an existing teacher. This will prevent errors when trying to associate a course with a non-existent teacher.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that the software meets the user's requirements and operates without issues. \n\nIf you need further assistance or clarification on any of these points, feel free to ask!"} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The migration script `migration.py` does not include a step to preserve existing data when adding the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table. This could lead to data loss or integrity issues if there are existing courses in the database.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade()` function in `migration.py` to include a step that ensures existing data is preserved when adding the `teacher_id` column.** This can be done by setting the `teacher_id` column to `NULL` for existing records, which is already handled since the column is nullable. However, it is essential to ensure that the migration does not disrupt existing relationships or data integrity.

2. **Ensure that the migration script is executed after the initial database setup to avoid conflicts.** 

Here’s an example of how you might adjust the migration script:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the Teacher table
    op.create_table('teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Add teacher_id to courses
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))
    # Optional: If you want to set a default value or handle existing records, you can add logic here
    # For example, setting teacher_id to NULL for existing courses is already handled by nullable=True
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- **Ensure that the `create_database()` function in `database.py` is called before running the migrations to create the initial tables.**
- **Consider adding validation in the API endpoints to check if the `teacher_id` provided in the `CourseCreate` model corresponds to an existing teacher. This will prevent errors when trying to associate a course with a non-existent teacher.**

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the software meets the user's requirements and operates without issues. 

If you need further assistance or clarification on any of these points, feel free to ask!"

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

This could lead to data loss or integrity issues if there are existing courses in the database.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Modify the upgrade() function in migration.py to include a step that ensures existing data is preserved when adding the teacher_id column. This can be done by setting the teacher_id column to NULL for existing records, which is already handled since the column is nullable. However, it is essential to ensure that the migration does not disrupt existing relationships or data integrity.\n\n2. Ensure that the migration script is executed after the initial database setup to avoid conflicts. \n\nHere’s an example of how you might adjust the migration script:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Create the Teacher table\n    op.create_table('teachers',\n        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n    )\n    # Add teacher_id to courses\n    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))\n    # Optional: If you want to set a default value or handle existing records, you can add logic here\n    # For example, setting teacher_id to NULL for existing courses is already handled by nullable=True\n\n\n### Additional Suggestions:\n- Ensure that the create_database() function in database.py is called before running the migrations to create the initial tables.\n- Consider adding validation in the API endpoints to check if the teacher_id provided in the CourseCreate model corresponds to an existing teacher. This will prevent errors when trying to associate a course with a non-existent teacher.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that the software meets the user's requirements and operates without issues. \n\nIf you need further assistance or clarification on any of these points, feel free to ask!"} |

1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided meets many of the requirements outlined in the task, but there are a few areas that need attention to ensure full compliance with the regulations and to enhance functionality. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The migration script `migration.py` does not include logic to preserve existing data when adding the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table. If the `courses` table already contains data, adding a new column without a default value could lead to issues. Additionally, the migration script should ensure that the existing data is not lost during the migration process.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade` function in `migration.py` to include a default value for the `teacher_id` column when it is added.** This will ensure that existing courses can still be migrated without data loss. You can set the default value to `NULL` or a specific teacher ID if applicable.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function in `migration.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the Teacher table
    op.create_table('teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Add teacher_id to courses with a default value of NULL
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True, server_default=None))
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- **Ensure that the `create_database` function in `database.py` is called at the right time** to create the tables before any data is inserted. This might be part of your application startup logic.
- **Consider adding validation in the `add_teacher` method** to ensure that the email format is correct before creating a new teacher.
- **Add error handling in the `add_course` method** to manage cases where the course creation fails for reasons other than the teacher ID not existing.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the software is robust, user-friendly, and compliant with the requirements set forth by the customer.

If you need further assistance or clarification on any of the points, feel free to ask!

If the courses table already contains data, adding a new column without a default value could lead to issues. Additionally, the migration script should ensure that the existing data is not lost during the migration process.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Modify the upgrade function in migration.py to include a default value for the teacher_id column when it is added. This will ensure that existing courses can still be migrated without data loss. You can set the default value to NULL or a specific teacher ID if applicable.\n\nHere’s how you can revise the upgrade function in migration.py:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Create the Teacher table\n    op.create_table('teachers',\n        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n    )\n    # Add teacher_id to courses with a default value of NULL\n    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True, server_default=None))\n\n\n### Additional Suggestions:\n- Ensure that the create_database function in database.py is called at the right time to create the tables before any data is inserted. This might be part of your application startup logic.\n- Consider adding validation in the add_teacher method to ensure that the email format is correct before creating a new teacher.\n- Add error handling in the add_course method to manage cases where the course creation fails for reasons other than the teacher ID not existing.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that the software is robust, user-friendly, and compliant with the requirements set forth by the customer.\n\nIf you need further assistance or clarification on any of the points, feel free to ask!"} |

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided meets many of the requirements outlined in the task, but there are a few areas that need attention to ensure full compliance with the regulations and to enhance functionality. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The migration script `migration.py` does not include logic to preserve existing data when adding the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table. If the `courses` table already contains data, adding a new column without a default value could lead to issues. Additionally, the migration script should ensure that the existing data is not lost during the migration process.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade` function in `migration.py` to include a default value for the `teacher_id` column when it is added.** This will ensure that existing courses can still be migrated without data loss. You can set the default value to `NULL` or a specific teacher ID if applicable.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function in `migration.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the Teacher table
    op.create_table('teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Add teacher_id to courses with a default value of NULL
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True, server_default=None))
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- **Ensure that the `create_database` function in `database.py` is called at the right time** to create the tables before any data is inserted. This might be part of your application startup logic.
- **Consider adding validation in the `add_teacher` method** to ensure that the email format is correct before creating a new teacher.
- **Add error handling in the `add_course` method** to manage cases where the course creation fails for reasons other than the teacher ID not existing.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the software is robust, user-friendly, and compliant with the requirements set forth by the customer.

If you need further assistance or clarification on any of the points, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
