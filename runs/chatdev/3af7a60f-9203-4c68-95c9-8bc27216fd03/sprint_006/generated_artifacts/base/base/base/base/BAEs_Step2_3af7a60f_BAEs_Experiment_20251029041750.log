To address the customer's task of adding an email field to the Student entity, we need to consider the best product modality for presenting this information. 

1. **Document**: This could be useful for providing a detailed report on the changes made to the Student entity, including the rationale behind adding the email field and the migration process.

2. **Dashboard**: If we want to visualize the data related to students, including their email addresses, a dashboard could provide real-time insights and analytics.

3. **Application**: If we are implementing a system that manages student data, an application could allow users to interact with the Student entity and manage email addresses effectively.

4. **Website**: A website could serve as a platform to showcase the updated Student entity and provide information on how to use the new email field.

What are your thoughts on these modalities? Which one do you think aligns best with the customer's needs?

I believe that the **Document** modality would be the most suitable choice for this task. It allows us to provide a comprehensive overview of the changes made to the Student entity, including the technical details of the database schema update and the migration process. This can serve as a reference for the customer and any developers involved in the implementation.

However, I also see the value in the **Application** modality, as it would allow for direct interaction with the updated Student entity and facilitate user management of email addresses.

What do you think? Should we lean towards the Document for a detailed report, or consider the Application for a more interactive approach?

I understand your perspective on the **Document** modality, as it indeed provides a thorough overview of the changes and serves as a valuable reference for the customer and developers. It ensures that all technical details are well-documented, which is crucial for clarity and future reference.

On the other hand, the **Application** modality offers a practical approach, allowing users to interact with the Student entity directly. This could enhance user experience and facilitate the management of email addresses in real-time.

Given the nature of the task, which primarily involves a structural update rather than an interactive feature, I lean towards the **Document** modality for its comprehensive documentation benefits. However, I acknowledge the importance of user interaction that the **Application** modality provides.

Perhaps we could prioritize the Document for this specific task while keeping the Application in mind for future enhancements. What do you think about this compromise?

I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of both modalities. Prioritizing the **Document** for this task makes sense, as it will provide the necessary documentation of the changes and ensure that all stakeholders are informed about the updates to the Student entity. This will be particularly useful for developers and the customer to understand the migration process and the rationale behind the addition of the email field.

We can certainly keep the **Application** modality in mind for future enhancements, especially if we want to create a more interactive experience for users managing student data.

With that in mind, I believe we have reached a consensus.

To address the task of adding an email field to the Student entity, I have reviewed the provided code and found several areas that need to be updated to meet the requirements. Here’s my highest priority comment and the corresponding suggestions for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `Student` model does not currently include the `email` field, which is required as per the task. Additionally, the `StudentCreate` schema does not include the email field, which means that the API will not accept it when creating a new student.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `Student` model in `models.py`** to include the `email` field:
   ```python
   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'students'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `StudentCreate` schema in `schemas.py`** to include the `email` field:
   ```python
   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: str  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `create_student` function in `routes.py`** to handle the email field:
   ```python
   @student_router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)  # Update this line
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return db_student
   ```

4. **Create a database migration script** to add the `email` column to the existing `students` table without losing existing data. You can use a migration tool like Alembic for this purpose. Here’s a basic example of what the migration might look like:
   ```python
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   def upgrade():
       op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False))

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_column('students', 'email')
   ```

5. **Update the GUI in `main.py`** to allow users to input the email when adding a new student:
   ```python
   self.label_email = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Student Email:")
   self.label_email.pack()
   self.entry_email = tk.Entry(master)
   self.entry_email.pack()
   ```

   Update the `submit` method to include the email:
   ```python
   def submit(self):
       name = self.entry.get()
       email = self.entry_email.get()  # Get email input
       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name, "email": email})  # Update this line
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer's requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity while preserving existing data.

### Summary of Changes Needed:
- Add `email` field to the `Student` model.
- Update `StudentCreate` schema to include `email`.
- Modify the `create_student` function to handle the new field.
- Create a migration script to add the email column.
- Update the GUI to allow email input.

Please proceed with these changes to ensure the software meets the requirements.

   self.entry_email = tk.Entry(master)
   self.entry_email.pack()
   ```

   Update the `submit` method to include the email:
   ```python
   def submit(self):
       name = self.entry.get()
       email = self.entry_email.get()  # Get email input
       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name, "email": email})  # Update this line

Additionally, the StudentCreate schema does not include the email field, which means that the API will not accept it when creating a new student.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Update the Student model in models.py to include the email field:\n   python\n   class Student(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'students\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Add this line\n\n\n2. Update the StudentCreate schema in schemas.py to include the email field:\n   python\n   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       email: str  # Add this line\n\n\n3. Update the create_student function in routes.py to handle the email field:\n   python\n   @student_router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)\n   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)  # Update this line\n       db.add(db_student)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_student)\n       return db_student\n\n\n4. Create a database migration script to add the email column to the existing students table without losing existing data. You can use a migration tool like Alembic for this purpose. Here’s a basic example of what the migration might look like:\n   python\n   from alembic import op\n   import sqlalchemy as sa\n\n   def upgrade():\n       op.add_column(\'students\', sa.Column(\'email\', sa.String(), nullable=False))\n\n   def downgrade():\n       op.drop_column(\'students\', \'email\')\n\n\n5. Update the GUI in main.py to allow users to input the email when adding a new student:\n   python\n   self.label_email = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Student Email:")\n   self.label_email.pack()\n   self.entry_email = tk.Entry(master)\n   self.entry_email.pack()\n\n\n   Update the submit method to include the email:\n   python\n   def submit(self):\n       name = self.entry.get()\n       email = self.entry_email.get()  # Get email input\n       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name, "email": email})  # Update this line\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer\'s requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity while preserving existing data.\n\n### Summary of Changes Needed:\n- Add email field to the Student model.\n- Update StudentCreate schema to include email.\n- Modify the create_student function to handle the new field.\n- Create a migration script to add the email column.\n- Update the GUI to allow email input.\n\nPlease proceed with these changes to ensure the software meets the requirements.\n\n'} |

Comments on Codes:
"To address the task of adding an email field to the Student entity, I have reviewed the provided code and found several areas that need to be updated to meet the requirements. Here’s my highest priority comment and the corresponding suggestions for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `Student` model does not currently include the `email` field, which is required as per the task. Additionally, the `StudentCreate` schema does not include the email field, which means that the API will not accept it when creating a new student.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `Student` model in `models.py`** to include the `email` field:
   ```python
   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'students'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `StudentCreate` schema in `schemas.py`** to include the `email` field:
   ```python
   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: str  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `create_student` function in `routes.py`** to handle the email field:
   ```python
   @student_router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)  # Update this line
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return db_student
   ```

4. **Create a database migration script** to add the `email` column to the existing `students` table without losing existing data. You can use a migration tool like Alembic for this purpose. Here’s a basic example of what the migration might look like:
   ```python
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   def upgrade():
       op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False))

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_column('students', 'email')
   ```

5. **Update the GUI in `main.py`** to allow users to input the email when adding a new student:
   ```python
   self.label_email = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Student Email:")
   self.label_email.pack()
   self.entry_email = tk.Entry(master)
   self.entry_email.pack()
   ```

   Update the `submit` method to include the email:
   ```python
   def submit(self):
       name = self.entry.get()
       email = self.entry_email.get()  # Get email input
       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name, "email": email})  # Update this line
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer's requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity while preserving existing data.

### Summary of Changes Needed:
- Add `email` field to the `Student` model.
- Update `StudentCreate` schema to include `email`.
- Modify the `create_student` function to handle the new field.
- Create a migration script to add the email column.
- Update the GUI to allow email input.

Please proceed with these changes to ensure the software meets the requirements.

Here’s my highest priority comment and the corresponding suggestions for revision:\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe Student model does not currently include the email field, which is required as per the task. Additionally, the StudentCreate schema does not include the email field, which means that the API will not accept it when creating a new student.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Update the Student model in models.py to include the email field:\n   python\n   class Student(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'students\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Add this line\n\n\n2. Update the StudentCreate schema in schemas.py to include the email field:\n   python\n   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       email: str  # Add this line\n\n\n3. Update the create_student function in routes.py to handle the email field:\n   python\n   @student_router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)\n   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)  # Update this line\n       db.add(db_student)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_student)\n       return db_student\n\n\n4. Create a database migration script to add the email column to the existing students table without losing existing data. You can use a migration tool like Alembic for this purpose. Here’s a basic example of what the migration might look like:\n   python\n   from alembic import op\n   import sqlalchemy as sa\n\n   def upgrade():\n       op.add_column(\'students\', sa.Column(\'email\', sa.String(), nullable=False))\n\n   def downgrade():\n       op.drop_column(\'students\', \'email\')\n\n\n5. Update the GUI in main.py to allow users to input the email when adding a new student:\n   python\n   self.label_email = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Student Email:")\n   self.label_email.pack()\n   self.entry_email = tk.Entry(master)\n   self.entry_email.pack()\n\n\n   Update the submit method to include the email:\n   python\n   def submit(self):\n       name = self.entry.get()\n       email = self.entry_email.get()  # Get email input\n       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name, "email": email})  # Update this line\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer\'s requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity while preserving existing data.\n\n### Summary of Changes Needed:\n- Add email field to the Student model.\n- Update StudentCreate schema to include email.\n- Modify the create_student function to handle the new field.\n- Create a migration script to add the email column.\n- Update the GUI to allow email input.\n\nPlease proceed with these changes to ensure the software meets the requirements.\n\n'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is generally well-structured and meets the requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the robustness of the application.

**Comment with the Highest Priority:**
The migration script does not include a mechanism to preserve existing Student data when adding the new email column. If the existing records do not have an email value, the migration will fail due to the `nullable=False` constraint.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. Update the migration script to set a default value for the email column or allow it to be nullable initially. This will prevent migration errors when existing records do not have an email value. You can later update the records with valid email addresses as needed.

Here’s how you can modify the `migration.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add email column as nullable first
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))  
    # Optionally, you can set a default value for existing records if needed
    # op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = 'default@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL")
    
    # After ensuring existing data is handled, you can alter the column to be non-nullable if required
    # op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
```

2. After running the migration, you can then update the email field for existing records if necessary.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process does not fail and that existing data is preserved.

Please proceed with the suggested changes to the migration script to ensure a smooth transition when adding the email field to the Student entity.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is generally well-structured and meets the requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the robustness of the application.

**Comment with the Highest Priority:**
The migration script does not include a mechanism to preserve existing Student data when adding the new email column. If the existing records do not have an email value, the migration will fail due to the `nullable=False` constraint.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. Update the migration script to set a default value for the email column or allow it to be nullable initially. This will prevent migration errors when existing records do not have an email value. You can later update the records with valid email addresses as needed.

Here’s how you can modify the `migration.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add email column as nullable first
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))  
    # Optionally, you can set a default value for existing records if needed
    # op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = 'default@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL")
    
    # After ensuring existing data is handled, you can alter the column to be non-nullable if required
    # op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
```

2. After running the migration, you can then update the email field for existing records if necessary.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process does not fail and that existing data is preserved.

Please proceed with the suggested changes to the migration script to ensure a smooth transition when adding the email field to the Student entity."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

After running the migration, you can then update the email field for existing records if necessary.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process does not fail and that existing data is preserved.\n\nPlease proceed with the suggested changes to the migration script to ensure a smooth transition when adding the email field to the Student entity.'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script. The migration script does not ensure that existing student data is preserved correctly when adding the new `email` field. Specifically, the `email` column is initially added as nullable, which could lead to inconsistencies if existing records are not updated appropriately.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The migration script should ensure that existing student records are updated to have a valid email value before altering the column to be non-nullable. This is crucial to prevent any potential data integrity issues.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the migration script to handle existing records properly.** You can either set a default email for existing records or ensure that the email field is populated with valid data before making it non-nullable.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function in `migration.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add email column as nullable first
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))  
    
    # Update existing records to have a default email or handle them as needed
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = 'default@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL")
    
    # After ensuring existing data is handled, you can alter the column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Consider adding validation in the `StudentCreate` schema to ensure that the email format is correct.
- Ensure that the application handles cases where the email might already exist for a student, depending on your business logic.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process maintains data integrity while fulfilling the requirements of the task. 

Please proceed with the suggested revisions to the migration script.

The migration script does not ensure that existing student data is preserved correctly when adding the new `email` field. Specifically, the `email` column is initially added as nullable, which could lead to inconsistencies if existing records are not updated appropriately.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The migration script should ensure that existing student records are updated to have a valid email value before altering the column to be non-nullable. This is crucial to prevent any potential data integrity issues.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the migration script to handle existing records properly.** You can either set a default email for existing records or ensure that the email field is populated with valid data before making it non-nullable.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function in `migration.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add email column as nullable first
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))  
    
    # Update existing records to have a default email or handle them as needed
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = 'default@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL")
    
    # After ensuring existing data is handled, you can alter the column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Consider adding validation in the `StudentCreate` schema to ensure that the email format is correct.
- Ensure that the application handles cases where the email might already exist for a student, depending on your business logic.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process maintains data integrity while fulfilling the requirements of the task. 

Please proceed with the suggested revisions to the migration script.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script. The migration script does not ensure that existing student data is preserved correctly when adding the new `email` field. Specifically, the `email` column is initially added as nullable, which could lead to inconsistencies if existing records are not updated appropriately.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The migration script should ensure that existing student records are updated to have a valid email value before altering the column to be non-nullable. This is crucial to prevent any potential data integrity issues.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the migration script to handle existing records properly.** You can either set a default email for existing records or ensure that the email field is populated with valid data before making it non-nullable.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function in `migration.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add email column as nullable first
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))  
    
    # Update existing records to have a default email or handle them as needed
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = 'default@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL")
    
    # After ensuring existing data is handled, you can alter the column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Consider adding validation in the `StudentCreate` schema to ensure that the email format is correct.
- Ensure that the application handles cases where the email might already exist for a student, depending on your business logic.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process maintains data integrity while fulfilling the requirements of the task. 

Please proceed with the suggested revisions to the migration script."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   pydantic
   alembic
   requests
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Database Migration**:
   Ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new email field. Run the migration script:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Start the Application**:
   Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
   ```bash
