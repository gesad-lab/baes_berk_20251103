To address the customer's requirement of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we should consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be a **Dashboard**, which would allow us to visualize the relationships between Courses and Teachers dynamically. This could provide insights into which teachers are associated with which courses and allow for real-time updates.

Another option might be a **Document**, where we can detail the changes made to the database schema and provide a comprehensive overview of the new relationships in a structured format.

We could also consider a **Website**, which could serve as a platform to showcase the updated Course and Teacher relationships, along with any relevant information or documentation.

What are your thoughts on these modalities?

I appreciate your insights on the potential modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic and interactive way to visualize the relationships between Courses and Teachers, which could be beneficial for users who want real-time insights. 

On the other hand, a **Document** would allow us to clearly outline the technical changes and provide a thorough explanation of the new relationships, which could be useful for stakeholders who need detailed information.

The **Website** option could serve as a more comprehensive platform to present the information, but it might be more complex to implement compared to the other two options.

Given the need for clarity and the technical nature of the task, I lean towards the **Document** modality for this particular requirement. However, I see the value in the Dashboard as well.

What do you think? Should we prioritize clarity with a Document or go for the interactive nature of a Dashboard?

I understand your perspective, and I agree that clarity is crucial, especially when dealing with technical changes like database schema updates. A **Document** would provide a structured and detailed explanation of the new relationships, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the modifications.

However, the **Dashboard** offers the advantage of interactivity and real-time visualization, which could enhance user engagement and provide immediate insights into the relationships between Courses and Teachers.

Considering the nature of the task and the audience we are addressing, I believe we should prioritize clarity and thoroughness with a **Document**. This will ensure that all technical aspects are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference.

Shall we finalize our decision on the Document modality?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a solid foundation but requires some modifications to fully implement the requested teacher relationship in the Course entity. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The necessary classes are imported in the relevant files.
2. **All methods should be implemented**: The methods are implemented, but the relationship between Course and Teacher is not established.
3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present but could be improved for clarity in some areas.
4. **No potential bugs**: There are no apparent bugs, but the logic for the relationship is incomplete.
5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The task is partially fulfilled; the relationship from Course to Teacher is missing.
6. **User interaction with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation does not allow for a Course to have a Teacher, which is a critical requirement.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
The most critical issue is that the relationship between the Course and Teacher entities has not been established in the models, and the database schema does not reflect this relationship. 

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` file** to include a foreign key relationship from the Course entity to the Teacher entity. This can be done by adding a `teacher_id` column in the Course class and establishing a relationship.

Here’s how you can modify the `models.py`:

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line for the relationship
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Establish the relationship with Teacher

class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line to establish the reverse relationship
```

2. **Update the `schemas.py` file** to include the teacher information in the Course response:

```python
class CourseResponse(CourseBase):
    id: int
    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to include teacher_id in the response
    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

3. **Update the database migration script in `main.py`** to include the new column for `teacher_id` in the Course table. You may need to create a new migration function to handle this properly without losing existing data.

By implementing these changes, the Course entity will be able to have a teacher, fulfilling the customer's requirements.

### Final Instruction:
After making these changes, ensure to run the migration script to update the database schema and verify that existing data is preserved.

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's request of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, I will modify the existing codebase accordingly.

```

These modifications ensure that the Course entity can have a relationship with the Teacher entity, and the database schema is updated accordingly while preserving existing data.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the task requirements. Here is the highest priority comment along with suggestions for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
The database migration script in `main.py` does not include the necessary migration logic to add the `teacher_id` foreign key to the `courses` table. This is crucial to ensure that the existing database schema is updated to support the new relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities without losing existing data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `upgrade` function in `main.py`:**
   - Add logic to check if the `teacher_id` column exists in the `courses` table. If it does not exist, add it as a foreign key referencing the `teachers` table.
   - Ensure that the migration preserves existing data in the `courses` table.

Here is an example of how you can modify the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create tables if they don't exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)  # This creates all tables including teachers
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Check if the students table exists before altering
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='students'"))
        if result.fetchone() is not None:
            # Check if the email column already exists
            result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students)"))
            columns = [row[1] for row in result.fetchall()]
            if 'email' not in columns:
                # Now alter the table to add the email column
                connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT NOT NULL'))  # Ensure this is NOT NULL
                # Update existing records with a default email
                connection.execute(text('UPDATE students SET email = "default@example.com" WHERE email IS NULL'))

        # Check if the courses table exists before altering
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='courses'"))
        if result.fetchone() is not None:
            # Check if the teacher_id column already exists
            result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(courses)"))
            columns = [row[1] for row in result.fetchall()]
            if 'teacher_id' not in columns:
                # Now alter the table to add the teacher_id column
                connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER'))  # Add teacher_id column
```

### Summary:
By implementing the above changes, you will ensure that the database migration correctly adds the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table, thus fulfilling the requirement of establishing a relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities while preserving existing data.

Please proceed with these modifications to ensure compliance with the task requirements.

                # Update existing records with a default email
                connection.execute(text('UPDATE students SET email = "default@example.com" WHERE email IS NULL'))

        # Check if the courses table exists before altering

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the task requirements. Here is the highest priority comment along with suggestions for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
The database migration script in `main.py` does not include the necessary migration logic to add the `teacher_id` foreign key to the `courses` table. This is crucial to ensure that the existing database schema is updated to support the new relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities without losing existing data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `upgrade` function in `main.py`:**
   - Add logic to check if the `teacher_id` column exists in the `courses` table. If it does not exist, add it as a foreign key referencing the `teachers` table.
   - Ensure that the migration preserves existing data in the `courses` table.

Here is an example of how you can modify the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create tables if they don't exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)  # This creates all tables including teachers
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Check if the students table exists before altering
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='students'"))
        if result.fetchone() is not None:
            # Check if the email column already exists
            result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students)"))
            columns = [row[1] for row in result.fetchall()]
            if 'email' not in columns:
                # Now alter the table to add the email column
                connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT NOT NULL'))  # Ensure this is NOT NULL
                # Update existing records with a default email
                connection.execute(text('UPDATE students SET email = "default@example.com" WHERE email IS NULL'))

        # Check if the courses table exists before altering
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='courses'"))
        if result.fetchone() is not None:
            # Check if the teacher_id column already exists
            result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(courses)"))
            columns = [row[1] for row in result.fetchall()]
            if 'teacher_id' not in columns:
                # Now alter the table to add the teacher_id column
                connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER'))  # Add teacher_id column
```

### Summary:
By implementing the above changes, you will ensure that the database migration correctly adds the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table, thus fulfilling the requirement of establishing a relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities while preserving existing data.

Please proceed with these modifications to ensure compliance with the task requirements."

Here is the highest priority comment along with suggestions for revision:\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe database migration script in main.py does not include the necessary migration logic to add the teacher_id foreign key to the courses table. This is crucial to ensure that the existing database schema is updated to support the new relationship between the Course and Teacher entities without losing existing data.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Update the upgrade function in main.py:\n   - Add logic to check if the teacher_id column exists in the courses table. If it does not exist, add it as a foreign key referencing the teachers table.\n   - Ensure that the migration preserves existing data in the courses table.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify the upgrade function:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Create tables if they don\'t exist\n    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)  # This creates all tables including teachers\n    with engine.connect() as connection:\n        # Check if the students table exists before altering\n        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type=\'table\' AND name=\'students\'"))\n        if result.fetchone() is not None:\n            # Check if the email column already exists\n            result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students)"))\n            columns = [row[1] for row in result.fetchall()]\n            if \'email\' not in columns:\n                # Now alter the table to add the email column\n                connection.execute(text(\'ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT NOT NULL\'))  # Ensure this is NOT NULL\n                # Update existing records with a default email\n                connection.execute(text(\'UPDATE students SET email = "default@example.com" WHERE email IS NULL\'))\n\n        # Check if the courses table exists before altering\n        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type=\'table\' AND name=\'courses\'"))\n        if result.fetchone() is not None:\n            # Check if the teacher_id column already exists\n            result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(courses)"))\n            columns = [row[1] for row in result.fetchall()]\n            if \'teacher_id\' not in columns:\n                # Now alter the table to add the teacher_id column\n                connection.execute(text(\'ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER\'))  # Add teacher_id column\n\n\n### Summary:\nBy implementing the above changes, you will ensure that the database migration correctly adds the teacher_id column to the courses table, thus fulfilling the requirement of establishing a relationship between the Course and Teacher entities while preserving existing data.\n\nPlease proceed with these modifications to ensure compliance with the task requirements.'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic**: The migration script in `main.py` does not handle the preservation of existing data when adding the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table. While the script checks for the existence of the column, it does not ensure that existing data in the `courses` table is preserved or properly updated to reflect the new relationship with the `Teacher` entity.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the Migration Logic**: When adding the `teacher_id` column, ensure that it is nullable and that existing records in the `courses` table are not affected negatively. You should also consider how to handle existing courses that may need to be associated with a teacher after the migration.

Here’s how you can revise the migration logic in `main.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create tables if they don't exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)  # This creates all tables including teachers
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Check if the students table exists before altering
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='students'"))
        if result.fetchone() is not None:
            # Check if the email column already exists
            result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students)"))
            columns = [row[1] for row in result.fetchall()]
            if 'email' not in columns:
                # Now alter the table to add the email column
                connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT NOT NULL'))  # Ensure this is NOT NULL
                # Update existing records with a default email
                connection.execute(text('UPDATE students SET email = "default@example.com" WHERE email IS NULL'))
        
        # Check if the courses table exists before altering
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='courses'"))
        if result.fetchone() is not None:
            # Check if the teacher_id column already exists
            result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(courses)"))
            columns = [row[1] for row in result.fetchall()]
            if 'teacher_id' not in columns:
                # Now alter the table to add the teacher_id column
                connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER'))  # Add teacher_id column
                # Optionally, set a default value for existing records if needed
                # connection.execute(text('UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = NULL WHERE teacher_id IS NULL'))
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Ensure that the migration script correctly handles the addition of the `teacher_id` column without disrupting existing data.
- Consider setting a default value for existing records if applicable, or leave it as `NULL` to indicate no teacher is assigned.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database migration preserves existing data and aligns with the user's requirements for the teacher relationship in the `Course` entity.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic**: The migration script in `main.py` does not handle the preservation of existing data when adding the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table. While the script checks for the existence of the column, it does not ensure that existing data in the `courses` table is preserved or properly updated to reflect the new relationship with the `Teacher` entity.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the Migration Logic**: When adding the `teacher_id` column, ensure that it is nullable and that existing records in the `courses` table are not affected negatively. You should also consider how to handle existing courses that may need to be associated with a teacher after the migration.

Here’s how you can revise the migration logic in `main.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create tables if they don't exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)  # This creates all tables including teachers
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Check if the students table exists before altering
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='students'"))
        if result.fetchone() is not None:
            # Check if the email column already exists
            result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students)"))
            columns = [row[1] for row in result.fetchall()]
            if 'email' not in columns:
                # Now alter the table to add the email column
                connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT NOT NULL'))  # Ensure this is NOT NULL
                # Update existing records with a default email
                connection.execute(text('UPDATE students SET email = "default@example.com" WHERE email IS NULL'))
        
        # Check if the courses table exists before altering
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='courses'"))
        if result.fetchone() is not None:
            # Check if the teacher_id column already exists
            result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(courses)"))
            columns = [row[1] for row in result.fetchall()]
            if 'teacher_id' not in columns:
                # Now alter the table to add the teacher_id column
                connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER'))  # Add teacher_id column
                # Optionally, set a default value for existing records if needed
                # connection.execute(text('UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = NULL WHERE teacher_id IS NULL'))
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Ensure that the migration script correctly handles the addition of the `teacher_id` column without disrupting existing data.
- Consider setting a default value for existing records if applicable, or leave it as `NULL` to indicate no teacher is assigned.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database migration preserves existing data and aligns with the user's requirements for the teacher relationship in the `Course` entity.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code structure and the use of SQLAlchemy for database management, as well as Pydantic for data validation, the following `requirements.txt` file can be created to specify the necessary dependencies for the project:

```plaintext
# requirements.txt

# SQLAlchemy for ORM and database management
SQLAlchemy==1.4.27

# Pydantic for data validation
pydantic==1.8.2

# SQLite support (included in Python standard library, but can specify version if needed)
# sqlite3 is part of the Python standard library, so it doesn't need to be listed

# FastAPI for building APIs (if applicable, based on the context of usage)
fastapi==0.68.1

# Additional dependencies can be added here as needed
```

This `requirements.txt` file includes the essential packages that are likely to be used in the project based on the provided code snippets. If you plan to use FastAPI for building the application, it is also included. Adjust the versions as necessary based on your project's compatibility and requirements.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# ChatDev Student Application

The ChatDev Student Application is designed to manage students, courses, and teachers efficiently. This application allows users to create and manage relationships between students and courses, as well as assign teachers to courses.

## Main Functions

- **Manage Students**: Create, read, update, and delete student records.
- **Manage Courses**: Create, read, update, and delete course records.
- **Assign Teachers**: Link teachers to courses, allowing for better organization and management of educational resources.
- **Student-Course Relationship**: Enable students to enroll in multiple courses and manage their course selections.

## Quick Install

To set up the ChatDev Student Application, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy pydantic
```

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatdev_student_app.git
   cd chatdev_student_app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the necessary packages.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Setup**: The application uses SQLite for database management. The database will be created automatically when you run the application for the first time.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Start the application by executing the `main.py` file.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Database Migration**: The application will automatically handle database migrations, including adding the `teacher_id` relationship to the `Course` entity. This ensures that existing data for students, courses, and teachers is preserved.

3. **Interacting with the Application**:
   - You can create new students, courses, and teachers using the defined API endpoints (if applicable).
   - Assign teachers to courses by specifying the `teacher_id` when creating or updating a course.
   - Enroll students in courses by linking them through the many-to-many relationship.

## Example Usage

### Creating a Course with a Teacher

To create a new course and assign a teacher, you can use the following example:

```python
from models import Course, Teacher
from database import get_db

db = next(get_db())
new_teacher = Teacher(name="John Doe", email="john.doe@example.com")
db.add(new_teacher)
db.commit()

new_course = Course(name="Mathematics", level="Beginner", teacher_id=new_teacher.id)
db.add(new_course)
db.commit()
```

### Querying Courses and Their Teachers

You can query courses and their associated teachers as follows:

```python
courses = db.query(Course).all()
for course in courses:
    print(f"Course: {course.name}, Teacher: {course.teacher.name if course.teacher else 'No teacher assigned'}")
```
