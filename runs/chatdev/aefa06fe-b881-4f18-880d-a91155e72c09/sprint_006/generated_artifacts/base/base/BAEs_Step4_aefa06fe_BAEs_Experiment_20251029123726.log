To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be a Dashboard, which would allow us to visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time. This could provide insights into course enrollments, student progress, and other relevant metrics.

Alternatively, we could consider a Document format, which would allow us to provide detailed documentation on the new relationship, including explanations and examples of how it works.

Another possibility is an Application that could implement a user interface for managing student-course relationships, allowing users to interact with the data directly.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you have a preference for one modality over the others?

I appreciate your insights on the potential modalities. 

The Dashboard option is compelling as it would provide a dynamic and interactive way to visualize the relationships and metrics related to students and courses. This could enhance user engagement and provide valuable insights at a glance.

However, the Document format could serve as a comprehensive resource for understanding the changes, which is also important for clarity and communication with stakeholders.

The Application could be a strong choice if we want to provide a hands-on tool for users to manage these relationships directly, which could enhance usability.

Considering the nature of the task and the need for both visualization and interactivity, I lean towards the Dashboard as it aligns well with our goal of providing real-time insights. 

What do you think? Should we proceed with the Dashboard, or do you feel strongly about another option?

I agree that the Dashboard is a strong choice for this task. Its ability to provide real-time insights and visualize the relationships between students and courses aligns perfectly with the customer's needs. This modality not only enhances user engagement but also allows for dynamic interaction with the data, making it easier for users to understand and manage the relationships effectively.

While the Document format and Application have their merits, the Dashboard's interactivity and visual appeal make it the most suitable option for this specific requirement. 

If we are both in agreement, we can finalize our decision on the Dashboard. Shall we proceed with that?

2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a solid foundation, but there are several areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of adding a course relationship to the Student entity. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` class is defined in `models.py`, but it is not imported in the `schemas.py` file where the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` classes are defined. This is not a direct issue but could lead to confusion if the `Course` model is needed elsewhere.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `Student` class does not have methods to manage the relationship with courses. We need to implement methods to add and retrieve courses for a student.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - The existing methods have comments, but the new methods that need to be added for managing course relationships will also need comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The migration script seems to handle the addition of the email column correctly, but the logic for creating the relationship between students and courses is missing.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The task of adding a relationship between `Student` and `Course` is not yet implemented. This is the most critical issue.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The current implementation does not allow students to have courses, which is a key requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities is not established in the code. We need to implement a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course` using an association table.

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Update `models.py` to include a many-to-many relationship**:
   - Create an association table to link `Student` and `Course`.
   - Update the `Student` and `Course` classes to reflect this relationship.

Here’s how you can implement this:

```python
# models.py
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table
student_courses = Table('student_courses', Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    
    # Relationship to courses
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    
    # Relationship to students
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update the `schemas.py` to include course relationships**:
   - Modify the `StudentResponse` schema to include a list of courses.

```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: List[CourseResponse]  # Include courses in the response
```

3. **Implement methods in `Student` to manage courses**:
   - Add methods to add and remove courses from a student.

```python
def add_course(self, course):
    """Add a course to the student."""
    self.courses.append(course)
    self.save()

def remove_course(self, course):
    """Remove a course from the student."""
    self.courses.remove(course)
    self.save()
```

4. **Update the migration script to create the association table**:
   - Ensure that the migration script creates the `student_courses` table.

```python
def upgrade():
    # Existing migration code...
    
    # Step 3: Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
```

By implementing these changes, the code will fulfill the requirement of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, allowing students to have courses while preserving existing data.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to establish the relationship between `Student` and `Course`, and ensure that the migration script is updated accordingly.

```python
# models.py
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table
student_courses = Table('student_courses', Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    
    # Relationship to courses
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    
    # Relationship to students
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update the `schemas.py` to include course relationships**:
   - Modify the `StudentResponse` schema to include a list of courses.

```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: List[CourseResponse]  # Include courses in the response
```

3. **Implement methods in `Student` to manage courses**:
   - Add methods to add and remove courses from a student.

```python
def add_course(self, course):
    """Add a course to the student."""
    self.courses.append(course)
    self.save()

def remove_course(self, course):
    """Remove a course from the student."""
    self.courses.remove(course)
    self.save()
```

4. **Update the migration script to create the association table**:
   - Ensure that the migration script creates the `student_courses` table.

```python
def upgrade():
    # Existing migration code...
    
    # Step 3: Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
```

By implementing these changes, the code will fulfill the requirement of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, allowing students to have courses while preserving existing data.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to establish the relationship between `Student` and `Course`, and ensure that the migration script is updated accordingly.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the task requirements. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `migration.py` script does not preserve existing data in the `student_courses` relationship table during the migration process. This could lead to data loss if any existing relationships between students and courses are present.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Preserve Existing Relationships:** Before creating the new `student_courses` table, you should ensure that any existing relationships are preserved. This can be done by creating a temporary table to store the existing relationships, then transferring them to the new `student_courses` table after it is created.

2. **Update the Migration Script:**
   - Modify the `upgrade()` function in `migration.py` to include steps for preserving existing relationships.

Here’s a revised version of the `upgrade()` function that includes these changes:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Step 1: Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True, index=True),
        Column('name', String, nullable=False),
        Column('level', String, nullable=False)
    )
    
    # Step 2: Add the email column as nullable first
    op.add_column('students', Column('email', String, nullable=True))
    
    # Step 3: Update existing records to set a default value for email
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = '' WHERE email IS NULL")
    
    # Step 4: Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Step 5: Create a temporary table to preserve existing relationships
    op.create_table(
        'temp_student_courses',
        Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
    
    # Step 6: Copy existing relationships to the temporary table
    op.execute("INSERT INTO temp_student_courses (student_id, course_id) SELECT student_id, course_id FROM student_courses")
    
    # Step 7: Create the new relationship table for students and courses
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
    
    # Step 8: Restore existing relationships from the temporary table
    op.execute("INSERT INTO student_courses (student_id, course_id) SELECT student_id, course_id FROM temp_student_courses")
    
    # Step 9: Drop the temporary table
    op.drop_table('temp_student_courses')
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, you will ensure that existing relationships between students and courses are preserved during the migration process, thus maintaining data integrity and fulfilling the customer's requirements.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the task requirements. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `migration.py` script does not preserve existing data in the `student_courses` relationship table during the migration process. This could lead to data loss if any existing relationships between students and courses are present.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Preserve Existing Relationships:** Before creating the new `student_courses` table, you should ensure that any existing relationships are preserved. This can be done by creating a temporary table to store the existing relationships, then transferring them to the new `student_courses` table after it is created.

2. **Update the Migration Script:**
   - Modify the `upgrade()` function in `migration.py` to include steps for preserving existing relationships.

Here’s a revised version of the `upgrade()` function that includes these changes:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Step 1: Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True, index=True),
        Column('name', String, nullable=False),
        Column('level', String, nullable=False)
    )
    
    # Step 2: Add the email column as nullable first
    op.add_column('students', Column('email', String, nullable=True))
    
    # Step 3: Update existing records to set a default value for email
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = '' WHERE email IS NULL")
    
    # Step 4: Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Step 5: Create a temporary table to preserve existing relationships
    op.create_table(
        'temp_student_courses',
        Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
    
    # Step 6: Copy existing relationships to the temporary table
    op.execute("INSERT INTO temp_student_courses (student_id, course_id) SELECT student_id, course_id FROM student_courses")
    
    # Step 7: Create the new relationship table for students and courses
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )
    
    # Step 8: Restore existing relationships from the temporary table
    op.execute("INSERT INTO student_courses (student_id, course_id) SELECT student_id, course_id FROM temp_student_courses")
    
    # Step 9: Drop the temporary table
    op.drop_table('temp_student_courses')
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, you will ensure that existing relationships between students and courses are preserved during the migration process, thus maintaining data integrity and fulfilling the customer's requirements.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `migration.py` script does not create the `student_courses` association table correctly. It attempts to copy existing relationships from a non-existent `student_courses` table, which could lead to errors during migration. Additionally, the `courses` table should be created before any relationships are established.**

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Ensure the `student_courses` table is created before attempting to copy existing relationships.** 
2. **Remove the step that tries to copy relationships from a non-existent table. Instead, focus on creating the new `student_courses` table and ensure that the migration script is logically sound.**

Here is the revised `migration.py` script:

```python
'''
Migration script to add email column to the existing students table and create courses table.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer, ForeignKey
from alembic import op

def upgrade():
    # Step 1: Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True, index=True),
        Column('name', String, nullable=False),
        Column('level', String, nullable=False)
    )
    # Step 2: Add the email column as nullable first
    op.add_column('students', Column('email', String, nullable=True))
    # Step 3: Update existing records to set a default value for email
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = '' WHERE email IS NULL")
    # Step 4: Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    # Step 5: Create the new relationship table for students and courses
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('student_courses')
    op.drop_table('courses')
    op.drop_column('students', 'email')
```

### Instructions:
- Replace the existing `migration.py` script with the revised version above.
- Ensure that the database migration is tested to confirm that it correctly creates the `courses` table and the `student_courses` association table without any errors.

By implementing these changes, the migration process will be more robust and aligned with the requirements, ensuring that the software can operate effectively without losing any features.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `migration.py` script does not create the `student_courses` association table correctly. It attempts to copy existing relationships from a non-existent `student_courses` table, which could lead to errors during migration. Additionally, the `courses` table should be created before any relationships are established.**

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Ensure the `student_courses` table is created before attempting to copy existing relationships.** 
2. **Remove the step that tries to copy relationships from a non-existent table. Instead, focus on creating the new `student_courses` table and ensure that the migration script is logically sound.**

Here is the revised `migration.py` script:

```python
'''
Migration script to add email column to the existing students table and create courses table.
'''

from alembic import op

def upgrade():
    # Step 1: Create the courses table

        'courses',
        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True, index=True),
        Column('name', String, nullable=False),
        Column('level', String, nullable=False)
    )
    # Step 2: Add the email column as nullable first

    # Step 3: Update existing records to set a default value for email
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = '' WHERE email IS NULL")
    # Step 4: Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    # Step 5: Create the new relationship table for students and courses
    op.create_table(

def downgrade():

### Instructions:
- Replace the existing `migration.py` script with the revised version above.
- Ensure that the database migration is tested to confirm that it correctly creates the `courses` table and the `student_courses` association table without any errors.

By implementing these changes, the migration process will be more robust and aligned with the requirements, ensuring that the software can operate effectively without losing any features."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:

```plaintext
SQLAlchemy==1.4.27
alembic==1.7.5
pydantic==1.9.0
tkinter  # Note: Tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to specify
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **SQLAlchemy**: This is the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used for database interactions.
- **Alembic**: This is a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy.
- **Pydantic**: This is used for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **Tkinter**: This is the standard GUI toolkit for Python, and it typically comes pre-installed with Python, so it doesn't need to be specified in the requirements file.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project needs or compatibility requirements.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries used, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:
```plaintext
SQLAlchemy==1.4.27
alembic==1.7.5
pydantic==1.9.0
tkinter  # Note: Tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to specify
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **SQLAlchemy**: This is the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used for database interactions.
- **Alembic**: This is a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy.
- **Pydantic**: This is used for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **Tkinter**: This is the standard GUI toolkit for Python, and it typically comes pre-installed with Python, so it doesn't need to be specified in the requirements file.
Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project needs or compatibility requirements. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
