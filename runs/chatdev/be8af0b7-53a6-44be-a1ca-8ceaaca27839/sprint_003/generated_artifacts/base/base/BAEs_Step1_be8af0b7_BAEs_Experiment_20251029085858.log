To address the customer's task of creating a simple web application for a Student entity, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a "Website." This modality allows us to effectively present the functionality of the application, including the API interactions and the ability to manage student data through a user-friendly interface. 

What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that a "Website" would be an excellent choice for this task. It allows for easy interaction with the API and provides a clear way for users to manage and view student data. Additionally, a web application can be easily accessed from any device with a browser, enhancing usability. 

Let's finalize this decision. What do you think?

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " <Python> *"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  <Python> *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure our application into multiple files following best practices. The application will include a FastAPI backend for handling API requests and a simple GUI using Tkinter for user interaction.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and sets up the database.
   - `create_app()`: Initializes the FastAPI app and sets up routes.
   - `create_database()`: Creates the SQLite database and the Student table if it doesn't exist.

2. **models.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
   - `Student`: SQLAlchemy model representing the Student entity.

3. **database.py**: Handles database connection and session management.
   - `get_db()`: Dependency that provides a database session.

4. **api.py**: Contains the API endpoints for the Student entity.
   - `create_student()`: Endpoint to create a new student.
   - `get_students()`: Endpoint to retrieve all students.

5. **gui.py**: Implements the GUI using Tkinter for user interaction.
   - `StudentApp`: Main application class for the GUI.
   - `add_student()`: Method to add a student via the GUI.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements outlined in the task. However, there are a few critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application operates correctly and meets the user's needs.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `create_student` function in `api.py` is missing a Pydantic model for request validation, which is a best practice in FastAPI applications. This can lead to potential issues if the input data is not validated properly.**

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Pydantic model for the Student entity**: This will ensure that the input data is validated before being processed. You can create a new file called `schemas.py` and define the model there.

2. **Update the `create_student` function to use the Pydantic model**: Modify the function to accept the model instead of a plain string.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Create `schemas.py`**:
   ```python
   '''
   Defines the Pydantic model for the Student entity.
   '''
   from pydantic import BaseModel
   
   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
   ```

2. **Update `api.py`**:
   ```python
   from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the new Pydantic model

   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Creates a new student.
       '''
       db_student = Student(name=student.name)  # Use the Pydantic model
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
   ```

### Summary:
By implementing a Pydantic model, you ensure that the API input is validated, which enhances the robustness of the application. This change is essential for maintaining best practices in FastAPI applications.

If you make these changes, the application will be more reliable and user-friendly.

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code structure is mostly correct, but there are several issues that need to be addressed to ensure that the application operates as intended and adheres to best practices. Here are the detailed reviews based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `api.py`, the `Student` model is being used directly, but it should be imported as a Pydantic model for request validation. You need to create a Pydantic model for the `Student` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `create_student` method in `api.py` is currently accepting a `Student` instance directly, which is incorrect. It should accept a Pydantic model instead.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - The comments are generally good, but the comments in `api.py` should specify that the `student` parameter is a Pydantic model.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The `create_student` method does not handle the case where the student name might be empty or invalid. This should be validated.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is good, but the API does not return JSON responses in the expected format due to the lack of a Pydantic model.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI in `main.py` is functional, but it relies on the API being correctly implemented. If the API does not validate inputs correctly, the user experience will suffer.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the API does not use Pydantic models for request validation, which is essential for FastAPI applications. This can lead to improper data being processed and does not conform to the requirement of returning JSON responses correctly.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. Create a Pydantic model for the `Student` entity in a new file called `schemas.py`:

```python
# schemas.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. Update the `api.py` to use the new Pydantic model:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the Pydantic model

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Creates a new student.
    '''
    if not student.name:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Name is required")
    
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list)
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Retrieves all students.
    '''
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return [{"id": student.id, "name": student.name} for student in students]
```

3. Ensure to import the new `schemas.py` in your `api.py` file.

By implementing these changes, the application will adhere to best practices and ensure proper validation and response formatting.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes for the web application, structured according to the specified format and best practices. Each file is presented with its name, language, documentation string, and the original code.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `api.py`, the `StudentModel` should be imported correctly. The current implementation does not import the Pydantic model for request validation.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `create_student` method in `api.py` should accept a Pydantic model for validation instead of the SQLAlchemy model directly. This is necessary for FastAPI to validate incoming requests.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are generally present, but the comments in `api.py` could be more descriptive regarding the expected input and output formats.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The `create_student` method does not handle the case where the `name` field might be empty or invalid. This could lead to database integrity issues.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is generally good, but the FastAPI application needs to be instantiated in `main.py` to run the server.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI in `main.py` should handle potential errors more gracefully and provide feedback to the user if the server is not running.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the API does not validate the incoming data correctly, which could lead to invalid entries in the database. The `create_student` function should use a Pydantic model for input validation.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Create a Pydantic model for the Student entity in a new file `schemas.py`:

```python
# schemas.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. Update `api.py` to use the Pydantic model:

```python
# api.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student as StudentModel
from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the Pydantic model
from database import get_db

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Creates a new student.
    '''
    if not student.name:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Name is required")
    
    db_student = StudentModel(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list)
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Retrieves all students.
    '''
    students = db.query(StudentModel).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return [{"id": student.id, "name": student.name} for student in students]
```

3. Ensure that `main.py` initializes the FastAPI application and includes the router:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from api import router
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database and tables
create_database()

# Include the router
app.include_router(router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the application will validate incoming requests correctly, ensuring that the `name` field is required and preventing potential bugs related to invalid data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the application meets the customer's requirements effectively.

The most critical issue is that the API does not validate the incoming data correctly, which could lead to invalid entries in the database. The `create_student` function should use a Pydantic model for input validation.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Create a Pydantic model for the Student entity in a new file `schemas.py`:

```python
# schemas.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. Update `api.py` to use the Pydantic model:

```python
# api.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student as StudentModel
from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the Pydantic model
from database import get_db

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Creates a new student.
    '''
    if not student.name:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Name is required")
    
    db_student = StudentModel(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list)
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Retrieves all students.
    '''
    students = db.query(StudentModel).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return [{"id": student.id, "name": student.name} for student in students]
```

3. Ensure that `main.py` initializes the FastAPI application and includes the router:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from api import router
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database and tables
create_database()

# Include the router
app.include_router(router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the application will validate incoming requests correctly, ensuring that the `name` field is required and preventing potential bugs related to invalid data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the application meets the customer's requirements effectively.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `api.py`, the `StudentModel` should be imported correctly. The current implementation does not import the Pydantic model for request validation.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `create_student` method in `api.py` should accept a Pydantic model for validation instead of the SQLAlchemy model directly. This is necessary for FastAPI to validate incoming requests.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are generally present, but the comments in `api.py` could be more descriptive regarding the expected input and output formats.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The `create_student` method does not handle the case where the `name` field might be empty or invalid. This could lead to database integrity issues.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is generally good, but the FastAPI application needs to be instantiated in `main.py` to run the server.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI in `main.py` should handle potential errors more gracefully and provide feedback to the user if the server is not running.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the API does not validate the incoming data correctly, which could lead to invalid entries in the database. The `create_student` function should use a Pydantic model for input validation.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Create a Pydantic model for the Student entity in a new file `schemas.py`:

```python
# schemas.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. Update `api.py` to use the Pydantic model:

```python
# api.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student as StudentModel
from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the Pydantic model
from database import get_db

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Creates a new student.
    '''
    if not student.name:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Name is required")
    
    db_student = StudentModel(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list)
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Retrieves all students.
    '''
    students = db.query(StudentModel).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return [{"id": student.id, "name": student.name} for student in students]
```

3. Ensure that `main.py` initializes the FastAPI application and includes the router:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from api import router
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database and tables
create_database()

# Include the router
app.include_router(router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the application will validate incoming requests correctly, ensuring that the `name` field is required and preventing potential bugs related to invalid data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the application meets the customer's requirements effectively."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[2025-29-10 09:01:57 INFO] Chief Product Officer: **Chief Product Officer<->Chief Executive Officer on : Manual, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Here is the `manual.md` file that provides a detailed user manual for the Student web application developed using FastAPI and SQLite.

# Student Web Application

A simple web application for managing Student entities using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

## Main Functions

This application allows users to perform the following functions:

- **Create a Student**: Add a new student with a required name field.
- **Retrieve Students**: Get a list of all students stored in the database.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.11+ installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Start the FastAPI application by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The application will start and listen on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Access the API**:
   You can interact with the API using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/).

3. **Create a Student**:
   To create a new student, send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/` with the following JSON body:
   ```json
   {
       "name": "John Doe"
   }
   ```
   A successful response will return the created student's ID and name:
   ```json
   {
       "id": 1,
       "name": "John Doe"
   }
   ```

4. **Retrieve Students**:
   To get a list of all students, send a GET request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/`. You can also use query parameters `skip` and `limit` to paginate the results:
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/?skip=0&limit=10
   ```
   The response will be a JSON array of students:
   ```json
   [
       {
           "id": 1,
           "name": "John Doe"
       },
       {
           "id": 2,
           "name": "Jane Smith"
       }
   ]
   ```

## API Documentation

For more detailed API documentation, you can visit the automatically generated Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
