To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be to use a **Dashboard**. This would allow us to visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time, providing an interactive experience for users to see which courses each student is enrolled in.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Document** format, where we could provide detailed descriptions of the relationships, including examples and explanations of how the data is structured.

Another possibility is to use a **Website** to create an interactive platform where users can explore the relationships between students and courses dynamically.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you have a preference for one modality over the others?

I appreciate your insights on the various options. A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic and interactive way to visualize the relationships between students and courses, which could be very beneficial for users who want to see real-time data and insights.

However, a **Website** could also serve a similar purpose while allowing for more detailed content and user interaction. It could include sections for both visualizations and textual explanations, making it a comprehensive resource.

On the other hand, a **Document** might be more suited for formal reporting or documentation purposes, but it may lack the interactivity that users might expect.

Given the nature of the task and the need for a clear visualization of relationships, I lean towards the **Dashboard** option. It aligns well with our goal of providing an engaging user experience.

What do you think? Should we proceed with the **Dashboard**?

I agree that a **Dashboard** would be the most effective choice for visualizing the relationships between students and courses. It offers interactivity and real-time insights, which are crucial for users to understand the data dynamically. 

While a **Website** could also provide valuable content, the focused and engaging nature of a **Dashboard** makes it a better fit for this specific task.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a solid foundation, but there are several areas that need attention to meet the requirements of adding a course relationship to the Student entity. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `StudentCreate` class is referenced in `routes.py` but is not defined or imported. This will cause a runtime error when trying to create a student.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The relationship between `Student` and `Course` is not established in the models. We need to add a many-to-many relationship.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are generally well-placed, but the new methods for managing the relationship will need comments as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: The migration logic in `migrate_database` is not handling the addition of the relationship correctly. We need to create an association table for the many-to-many relationship.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current implementation does not fulfill the requirement of allowing students to have courses.

6. **User interaction**: The API does not provide endpoints for associating courses with students, which is essential for user interaction.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the relationship between `Student` and `Course` is not defined, and the necessary database schema updates to support this relationship are missing. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Relationship in `models.py`**:
   Add an association table for the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey

   student_courses = Table('student_courses', Base.metadata,
       Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
       Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
   )

   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'students'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
   ```

2. **Update the Migration Logic in `migrate_database`**:
   Ensure that the association table is created during the migration.

   ```python
   if 'student_courses' not in metadata.tables:
       student_courses.create(bind=engine)
   ```

3. **Add Endpoints for Course Enrollment**:
   Create endpoints in `routes.py` to allow students to enroll in courses and retrieve their courses.

   ```python
   @router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
   def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
       course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
       if not student or not course:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
       student.courses.append(course)
       db.commit()
       return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}
   ```

4. **Update Comments**: Ensure that all new methods and changes have appropriate comments explaining their purpose.

By implementing these changes, the application will fulfill the customer's requirements and allow for proper interaction with the Student and Course entities.

### Final Instruction:
Please revise the code as suggested to establish the relationship and ensure the application meets the requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a solid foundation, but there are several areas that need attention to meet the requirements of adding a course relationship to the Student entity. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `StudentCreate` class is referenced in `routes.py` but is not defined or imported. This will cause a runtime error when trying to create a student.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The relationship between `Student` and `Course` is not established in the models. We need to add a many-to-many relationship.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are generally well-placed, but the new methods for managing the relationship will need comments as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: The migration logic in `migrate_database` is not handling the addition of the relationship correctly. We need to create an association table for the many-to-many relationship.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current implementation does not fulfill the requirement of allowing students to have courses.

6. **User interaction**: The API does not provide endpoints for associating courses with students, which is essential for user interaction.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the relationship between `Student` and `Course` is not defined, and the necessary database schema updates to support this relationship are missing. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Relationship in `models.py`**:
   Add an association table for the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey

   student_courses = Table('student_courses', Base.metadata,
       Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
       Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
   )

   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'students'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
   ```

2. **Update the Migration Logic in `migrate_database`**:
   Ensure that the association table is created during the migration.

   ```python
   if 'student_courses' not in metadata.tables:
       student_courses.create(bind=engine)
   ```

3. **Add Endpoints for Course Enrollment**:
   Create endpoints in `routes.py` to allow students to enroll in courses and retrieve their courses.

   ```python
   @router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
   def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
       course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
       if not student or not course:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
       student.courses.append(course)
       db.commit()
       return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}
   ```

4. **Update Comments**: Ensure that all new methods and changes have appropriate comments explaining their purpose.

By implementing these changes, the application will fulfill the customer's requirements and allow for proper interaction with the Student and Course entities.

### Final Instruction:
Please revise the code as suggested to establish the relationship and ensure the application meets the requirements."

Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: The StudentCreate class is referenced in routes.py but is not defined or imported. This will cause a runtime error when trying to create a student.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: The relationship between Student and Course is not established in the models. We need to add a many-to-many relationship.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: Comments are generally well-placed, but the new methods for managing the relationship will need comments as well.\n\n4. No potential bugs: The migration logic in migrate_database is not handling the addition of the relationship correctly. We need to create an association table for the many-to-many relationship.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The current implementation does not fulfill the requirement of allowing students to have courses.\n\n6. User interaction: The API does not provide endpoints for associating courses with students, which is essential for user interaction.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is that the relationship between Student and Course is not defined, and the necessary database schema updates to support this relationship are missing. \n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Define the Relationship in models.py:\n   Add an association table for the many-to-many relationship between Student and Course.\n\n   python\n   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey\n\n   student_courses = Table(\'student_courses\', Base.metadata,\n       Column(\'student_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n       Column(\'course_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n   )\n\n   class Student(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'students\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")\n\n   class Course(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n\n\n2. Update the Migration Logic in migrate_database:\n   Ensure that the association table is created during the migration.\n\n   python\n   if \'student_courses\' not in metadata.tables:\n       student_courses.create(bind=engine)\n\n\n3. Add Endpoints for Course Enrollment:\n   Create endpoints in routes.py to allow students to enroll in courses and retrieve their courses.\n\n   python\n   @router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")\n   def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()\n       course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n       if not student or not course:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")\n       student.courses.append(course)\n       db.commit()\n       return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}\n\n\n4. Update Comments: Ensure that all new methods and changes have appropriate comments explaining their purpose.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will fulfill the customer\'s requirements and allow for proper interaction with the Student and Course entities.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease revise the code as suggested to establish the relationship and ensure the application meets the requirements.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements outlined in the task. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure full compliance with the regulations and to enhance the functionality of the application.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic for Existing Data Preservation:**
The current migration logic in `migrate_database()` does not handle the creation of the `student_courses` association table correctly. If the association table already exists, it should not attempt to create it again, and there should be a check to ensure that existing relationships between students and courses are preserved. 

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `migrate_database()` function** to include checks for the existence of the `student_courses` table and ensure that it does not attempt to recreate it if it already exists. This will prevent potential data loss or integrity issues.

2. **Add a check for existing relationships** in the `student_courses` table to ensure that any existing enrollments are preserved during the migration process.

Here’s how you can revise the `migrate_database()` function:

```python
def migrate_database():
    '''
    Migrates the database to add the email column to the Student table and create the Course table.
    '''
    metadata = MetaData(bind=engine)
    
    # Check if the students table exists
    if 'students' in metadata.tables:
        students_table = Table('students', metadata, autoload_with=engine)
        # Check if the email column already exists
        if 'email' not in students_table.columns:
            with engine.connect() as connection:
                # Add the email column as nullable first
                connection.execute('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email STRING')
                # Then update existing records to have a default value or handle accordingly
                connection.execute('UPDATE students SET email = "default@example.com" WHERE email IS NULL')
                # Finally, alter the column to be NOT NULL
                connection.execute('ALTER TABLE students RENAME TO students_temp')
                connection.execute('CREATE TABLE students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name STRING NOT NULL, email STRING NOT NULL)')
                connection.execute('INSERT INTO students (id, name, email) SELECT id, name, email FROM students_temp')
                connection.execute('DROP TABLE students_temp')
    else:
        print("The 'students' table does not exist.")
    
    # Create the courses table if it does not exist
    if 'courses' not in metadata.tables:
        Course.__table__.create(bind=engine)
    
    # Create the association table if it does not exist
    if 'student_courses' not in metadata.tables:
        student_courses.create(bind=engine)
    else:
        print("The 'student_courses' table already exists. No changes made.")
```

### Summary:
- Ensure that the migration logic checks for the existence of the `student_courses` table and does not attempt to recreate it if it already exists.
- Preserve existing relationships in the `student_courses` table during migrations.

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and compliant with the requirements, ensuring that existing data is preserved during migrations. 

If you make these adjustments, the code will be ready for deployment.

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a course relationship to the Student entity. However, there are some areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations outlined. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic**: The migration logic in the `migrate_database` function does not properly handle the addition of the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`. Specifically, the `student_courses` association table is created, but there is no logic to migrate existing data to this new structure. This could lead to data loss or inconsistency if existing students and courses need to be linked.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `migrate_database` function**: After creating the `student_courses` table, you need to implement logic to populate this table with existing relationships if any exist. If there are no existing relationships, you can skip this step.

Here’s a suggested implementation for the migration logic:

```python
def migrate_database():
    '''
    Migrates the database to add the email column to the Student table and create the Course table.
    '''
    metadata = MetaData(bind=engine)
    
    # Existing migration logic for students table...
    
    # Create the courses table if it does not exist
    if 'courses' not in metadata.tables:
        Course.__table__.create(bind=engine)
    
    # Create the association table if it does not exist
    if 'student_courses' not in metadata.tables:
        student_courses.create(bind=engine)
    
    # Logic to migrate existing data into the student_courses table if necessary
    # This part assumes you have a way to know which students are enrolled in which courses
    # For example, if you had a previous structure or a way to determine this
    # You would need to implement that logic here
    # Example:
    # existing_enrollments = get_existing_enrollments()  # This function needs to be defined
    # for enrollment in existing_enrollments:
    #     connection.execute(student_courses.insert().values(student_id=enrollment.student_id, course_id=enrollment.course_id))
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that you have a method to retrieve existing enrollments if they exist, or document how to handle this if the data is not available.
- Add error handling in the migration process to manage any potential issues that may arise during the migration.

By addressing this migration logic, you will ensure that the software can operate correctly without losing any existing relationships between students and courses.

### Conclusion:
Please implement the suggested changes to the migration logic to ensure that the application meets the requirements fully and maintains data integrity.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you encountered indicates a circular import issue between the `models.py` and `database.py` files. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

### Summary of the Issue:
1. **Circular Import**: 
   - In `models.py`, you are importing `Base` from `database.py` to define your SQLAlchemy models (`Student` and `Course`).
   - In `database.py`, you are importing `Course`, `Student`, and `student_courses` from `models.py` to create the database tables and perform migrations.
   - This creates a circular dependency where `models.py` needs `database.py` to be fully initialized, while `database.py` also needs `models.py` to be fully initialized.

### Specific Lines Causing the Issue:
- In `models.py`:
  ```python
  from database import Base
  ```
- In `database.py`:
  ```python
  from models import Course, Student, student_courses
  ```

### Solution:
To resolve this circular import issue, you can refactor the code in the following ways:

1. **Move the `Base` Definition**: 
   - You can define the `Base` in a separate module (e.g., `base.py`) and import it in both `models.py` and `database.py`. This way, both modules can access `Base` without causing a circular dependency.

2. **Lazy Import**: 
   - Alternatively, you can use lazy imports within functions instead of at the module level. For example, import `Course` and `Student` inside the `create_database` function in `database.py`.

### Example Refactor:
Here’s how you can implement the first solution by creating a new file called `base.py`:

**base.py**
```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()
```

**models.py**
```python
'''
Defines the SQLAlchemy models for the Student and Course entities.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from base import Base  # Updated import
student_courses = Table('student_courses', Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)
class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

**database.py**
```python
'''
Handles database connections and session management.
'''
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session
from models import Course, Student, student_courses  
from base import Base  # Updated import
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
def create_database():
    '''
    Creates the database and tables if they do not exist.
    '''
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # Create tables first
    migrate_database()  # Then perform migration
# ... rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By implementing this change, you should be able to eliminate the circular import issue and run your application successfully.

[2025-29-10 02:54:15 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The error message you encountered indicates a circular import issue between the `models.py` and `database.py` files. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

### Summary of the Issue:
1. **Circular Import**: 
   - In `models.py`, you are importing `Base` from `database.py` to define your SQLAlchemy models (`Student` and `Course`).
   - In `database.py`, you are importing `Course`, `Student`, and `student_courses` from `models.py` to create the database tables and perform migrations.
   - This creates a circular dependency where `models.py` needs `database.py` to be fully initialized, while `database.py` also needs `models.py` to be fully initialized.

### Specific Lines Causing the Issue:
- In `models.py`:
  ```python
  from database import Base
  ```
- In `database.py`:
  ```python
  from models import Course, Student, student_courses
  ```

### Solution:
To resolve this circular import issue, you can refactor the code in the following ways:

1. **Move the `Base` Definition**: 
   - You can define the `Base` in a separate module (e.g., `base.py`) and import it in both `models.py` and `database.py`. This way, both modules can access `Base` without causing a circular dependency.

2. **Lazy Import**: 
   - Alternatively, you can use lazy imports within functions instead of at the module level. For example, import `Course` and `Student` inside the `create_database` function in `database.py`.

ImportError: cannot import name 'Course' from partially initialized module 'models' (most likely due to a circular import) (models.py)
"
Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you encountered indicates a circular import issue between the `models.py` and `database.py` files. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

### Summary of the Issue:
1. **Circular Import**: 
   - In `models.py`, you are importing `Base` from `database.py` to define your SQLAlchemy models (`Student` and `Course`).
   - In `database.py`, you are importing `Course`, `Student`, and `student_courses` from `models.py` to create the database tables and perform migrations.
   - This creates a circular dependency where `models.py` needs `database.py` to be fully initialized, while `database.py` also needs `models.py` to be fully initialized.

### Specific Lines Causing the Issue:
- In `models.py`:
  ```python
  from database import Base
  ```
- In `database.py`:
  ```python
  from models import Course, Student, student_courses
  ```

### Solution:
To resolve this circular import issue, you can refactor the code in the following ways:

1. **Move the `Base` Definition**: 
   - You can define the `Base` in a separate module (e.g., `base.py`) and import it in both `models.py` and `database.py`. This way, both modules can access `Base` without causing a circular dependency.

2. **Lazy Import**: 
   - Alternatively, you can use lazy imports within functions instead of at the module level. For example, import `Course` and `Student` inside the `create_database` function in `database.py`.

### Example Refactor:
Here’s how you can implement the first solution by creating a new file called `base.py`:

**base.py**
```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()
```

**models.py**
```python
'''
Defines the SQLAlchemy models for the Student and Course entities.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from base import Base  # Updated import
student_courses = Table('student_courses', Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)
class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

**database.py**
```python
'''
Handles database connections and session management.
'''
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session
from models import Course, Student, student_courses  
from base import Base  # Updated import
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
def create_database():
    '''
    Creates the database and tables if they do not exist.
    '''
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # Create tables first
    migrate_database()  # Then perform migration
# ... rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By implementing this change, you should be able to eliminate the circular import issue and run your application successfully."

Here\'s a breakdown of the problem:\n\n### Summary of the Issue:\n1. Circular Import: \n   - In models.py, you are importing Base from database.py to define your SQLAlchemy models (Student and Course).\n   - In database.py, you are importing Course, Student, and student_courses from models.py to create the database tables and perform migrations.\n   - This creates a circular dependency where models.py needs database.py to be fully initialized, while database.py also needs models.py to be fully initialized.\n\n### Specific Lines Causing the Issue:\n- In models.py:\n  python\n  from database import Base\n\n- In database.py:\n  python\n  from models import Course, Student, student_courses\n\n\n### Solution:\nTo resolve this circular import issue, you can refactor the code in the following ways:\n\n1. Move the Base Definition: \n   - You can define the Base in a separate module (e.g., base.py) and import it in both models.py and database.py. This way, both modules can access Base without causing a circular dependency.\n\n2. Lazy Import: \n   - Alternatively, you can use lazy imports within functions instead of at the module level. For example, import Course and Student inside the create_database function in database.py.\n\n### Example Refactor:\nHere’s how you can implement the first solution by creating a new file called base.py:\n\nbase.py\npython\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nmodels.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nDefines the SQLAlchemy models for the Student and Course entities.\n\'\'\'\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Table, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\nfrom base import Base  # Updated import\nstudent_courses = Table(\'student_courses\', Base.metadata,\n    Column(\'student_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n    Column(\'course_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n)\nclass Student(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'students\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n\n\ndatabase.py\npython\n\'\'\'\nHandles database connections and session management.\n\'\'\'\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session\nfrom models import Course, Student, student_courses  \nfrom base import Base  # Updated import\nDATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"\nengine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})\nSessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)\ndef create_database():\n    \'\'\'\n    Creates the database and tables if they do not exist.\n    \'\'\'\n    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # Create tables first\n    migrate_database()  # Then perform migration\n# ... rest of the code remains unchanged\n\n\nBy implementing this change, you should be able to eliminate the circular import issue and run your application successfully.'} |

The error message you are encountering indicates that there is a circular import issue in your code. Here's a summary of the problem and its cause:

### Circular Import Issue

1. **Circular Import Explanation**:
   - In Python, a circular import occurs when two or more modules attempt to import each other directly or indirectly, leading to a situation where the interpreter cannot resolve the imports because it encounters a module that is not fully initialized.

2. **Specifics of the Error**:
   - The error traceback shows that `main.py` imports `routes.py`, which in turn imports `models.py`. 
   - Inside `models.py`, there is an import statement for `Base` from `database.py`, which also imports `Course` and `Student` from `models.py`.
   - This creates a loop: `models.py` imports from `database.py`, which imports from `models.py`, leading to a situation where `models.py` is not fully initialized when `database.py` tries to access it.

### Suggested Fixes

To resolve this circular import issue, you can consider the following approaches:

1. **Reorganize Imports**:
   - Move the import statements inside functions or methods where they are needed, rather than at the top of the module. This way, the import will only be executed when the function is called, avoiding the circular dependency at the module level.

2. **Refactor Code**:
   - Consider refactoring the code structure. For example, you could separate the database connection logic and model definitions into different modules to avoid circular dependencies.

3. **Use Lazy Imports**:
   - If the imports are only needed in specific functions, you can import them within those functions to avoid circular dependencies.

### Example Fix

Here’s an example of how you might adjust the imports to avoid the circular import:

In `models.py`, you can modify the import of `Base`:

```python
# models.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Move the import of Base here to avoid circular import
from database import Base

student_courses = Table('student_courses', Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

In `database.py`, ensure that you import `models` only after defining `Base`:

```python
# database.py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
Base = declarative_base()

# Import models after Base is defined
from models import Course, Student, student_courses  
```

By reorganizing the imports, you can eliminate the circular dependency and resolve the import error.

# Import models after Base is defined

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you are encountering indicates that there is a circular import issue in your code. Here's a summary of the problem and its cause:

### Circular Import Issue

1. **Circular Import Explanation**:
   - In Python, a circular import occurs when two or more modules attempt to import each other directly or indirectly, leading to a situation where the interpreter cannot resolve the imports because it encounters a module that is not fully initialized.

2. **Specifics of the Error**:
   - The error traceback shows that `main.py` imports `routes.py`, which in turn imports `models.py`. 
   - Inside `models.py`, there is an import statement for `Base` from `database.py`, which also imports `Course` and `Student` from `models.py`.
   - This creates a loop: `models.py` imports from `database.py`, which imports from `models.py`, leading to a situation where `models.py` is not fully initialized when `database.py` tries to access it.

### Suggested Fixes

To resolve this circular import issue, you can consider the following approaches:

1. **Reorganize Imports**:
   - Move the import statements inside functions or methods where they are needed, rather than at the top of the module. This way, the import will only be executed when the function is called, avoiding the circular dependency at the module level.

2. **Refactor Code**:
   - Consider refactoring the code structure. For example, you could separate the database connection logic and model definitions into different modules to avoid circular dependencies.

3. **Use Lazy Imports**:
   - If the imports are only needed in specific functions, you can import them within those functions to avoid circular dependencies.

### Example Fix

Here’s an example of how you might adjust the imports to avoid the circular import:

In `models.py`, you can modify the import of `Base`:

```python
# models.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Move the import of Base here to avoid circular import
from database import Base

student_courses = Table('student_courses', Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

In `database.py`, ensure that you import `models` only after defining `Base`:

```python
# database.py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here\'s a summary of the problem and its cause:\n\n### Circular Import Issue\n\n1. Circular Import Explanation:\n   - In Python, a circular import occurs when two or more modules attempt to import each other directly or indirectly, leading to a situation where the interpreter cannot resolve the imports because it encounters a module that is not fully initialized.\n\n2. Specifics of the Error:\n   - The error traceback shows that main.py imports routes.py, which in turn imports models.py. \n   - Inside models.py, there is an import statement for Base from database.py, which also imports Course and Student from models.py.\n   - This creates a loop: models.py imports from database.py, which imports from models.py, leading to a situation where models.py is not fully initialized when database.py tries to access it.\n\n### Suggested Fixes\n\nTo resolve this circular import issue, you can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Reorganize Imports:\n   - Move the import statements inside functions or methods where they are needed, rather than at the top of the module. This way, the import will only be executed when the function is called, avoiding the circular dependency at the module level.\n\n2. Refactor Code:\n   - Consider refactoring the code structure. For example, you could separate the database connection logic and model definitions into different modules to avoid circular dependencies.\n\n3. Use Lazy Imports:\n   - If the imports are only needed in specific functions, you can import them within those functions to avoid circular dependencies.\n\n### Example Fix\n\nHere’s an example of how you might adjust the imports to avoid the circular import:\n\nIn models.py, you can modify the import of Base:\n\npython\n# models.py\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Table, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n\n# Move the import of Base here to avoid circular import\nfrom database import Base\n\nstudent_courses = Table(\'student_courses\', Base.metadata,\n    Column(\'student_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n    Column(\'course_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n)\n\nclass Student(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'students\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")\n\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n\n\nIn database.py, ensure that you import models only after defining Base:\n\npython\n# database.py\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session\n\nDATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"\nengine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})\nSessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n# Import models after Base is defined\nfrom models import Course, Student, student_courses  \n\n\nBy reorganizing the imports, you can eliminate the circular dependency and resolve the import error.'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you received indicates that there is a circular import issue in your code. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

### Summary of the Bug:

1. **Circular Import**:
   - The error message states: `ImportError: cannot import name 'Course' from partially initialized module 'models' (most likely due to a circular import)`.
   - This suggests that there is a circular dependency between the `models.py` and `database.py` files.

### Detailed Analysis:

- In `models.py`, you have the following import statement:
  ```python
  from database import Base
  ```
  This imports `Base` from `database.py`.

- In `database.py`, you have:
  ```python
  from models import Course, Student, student_courses
  ```
  This imports `Course`, `Student`, and `student_courses` from `models.py`.

- The issue arises because `models.py` is trying to import `Base` from `database.py`, while `database.py` is simultaneously trying to import `Course` and `Student` from `models.py`. This creates a circular reference where each module is waiting for the other to finish loading, leading to a partially initialized module error.

### Solution:

To resolve this circular import issue, you can follow these steps:

1. **Reorganize Imports**:
   - Move the import of `Base` in `models.py` to the bottom of the file, after the class definitions. This way, the classes are defined before the import occurs.

2. **Use Local Imports**:
   - Alternatively, you can use local imports within functions or methods where needed, instead of importing at the top of the file. This can help avoid circular dependencies.

### Example Fix:

Here’s how you can adjust the `models.py` file:

```python
'''
Defines the SQLAlchemy models for the Student and Course entities.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Define the association table first
student_courses = Table('student_courses', Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")

# Import Base here to avoid circular import
from database import Base
```

By making these changes, you should be able to eliminate the circular import issue and successfully run your application.

"
Error Summary of Test Reports:
"The error message you received indicates that there is a circular import issue in your code. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

### Summary of the Bug:

1. **Circular Import**:
   - The error message states: `ImportError: cannot import name 'Course' from partially initialized module 'models' (most likely due to a circular import)`.
   - This suggests that there is a circular dependency between the `models.py` and `database.py` files.

### Detailed Analysis:

- In `models.py`, you have the following import statement:
  ```python
  from database import Base
  ```
  This imports `Base` from `database.py`.

- In `database.py`, you have:
  ```python
  from models import Course, Student, student_courses
  ```
  This imports `Course`, `Student`, and `student_courses` from `models.py`.

- The issue arises because `models.py` is trying to import `Base` from `database.py`, while `database.py` is simultaneously trying to import `Course` and `Student` from `models.py`. This creates a circular reference where each module is waiting for the other to finish loading, leading to a partially initialized module error.

### Solution:

To resolve this circular import issue, you can follow these steps:

1. **Reorganize Imports**:
   - Move the import of `Base` in `models.py` to the bottom of the file, after the class definitions. This way, the classes are defined before the import occurs.

2. **Use Local Imports**:
   - Alternatively, you can use local imports within functions or methods where needed, instead of importing at the top of the file. This can help avoid circular dependencies.

### Example Fix:

Here’s how you can adjust the `models.py` file:

```python
'''
Defines the SQLAlchemy models for the Student and Course entities.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Define the association table first
student_courses = Table('student_courses', Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")

# Import Base here to avoid circular import
from database import Base
```

By making these changes, you should be able to eliminate the circular import issue and successfully run your application."

These changes resolve the circular import issue by reorganizing the imports in both `models.py` and `database.py`. The `Base` import in `models.py` is now placed after the class definitions, and the import of `student_courses` in `database.py` is done after defining `Base`. This ensures that the modules can be loaded without circular dependencies.

These changes resolve the circular import issue by reorganizing the imports in both `models.py` and `database.py`. The `Base` import in `models.py` is now placed after the class definitions, and the import of `student_courses` in `database.py` is done after defining `Base`. This ensures that the modules can be loaded without circular dependencies.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, the project uses FastAPI for building the web application and SQLAlchemy for database interactions. Additionally, since the project is using SQLite as the database, we need to include the necessary dependencies for these libraries. Here’s a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the required packages:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
```

### Explanation of the Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The main framework used for building the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management, which is essential for the request models in FastAPI.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers according to your project's requirements or the latest stable versions available at the time of installation.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, the project uses FastAPI for building the web application and SQLAlchemy for database interactions. Additionally, since the project is using SQLite as the database, we need to include the necessary dependencies for these libraries. Here’s a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the required packages:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
```
### Explanation of the Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The main framework used for building the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management, which is essential for the request models in FastAPI.
Make sure to adjust the version numbers according to your project's requirements or the latest stable versions available at the time of installation.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
