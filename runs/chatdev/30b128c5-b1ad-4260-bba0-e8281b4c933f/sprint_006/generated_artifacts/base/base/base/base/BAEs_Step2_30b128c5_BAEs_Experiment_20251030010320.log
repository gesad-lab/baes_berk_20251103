To address the customer's task of adding an email field to the Student entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information. Given the nature of the task, it seems that a structured format would be most appropriate. 

I suggest we consider using a Document format (.docx) to outline the changes made to the Student entity, including the new email field, and provide a clear explanation of the database schema update and migration process. This would allow us to present the information in a formal and organized manner.

What are your thoughts on this approach? Do you have any other product modalities in mind that could effectively convey this information?

I appreciate your suggestion of using a Document format (.docx) to outline the changes. However, I believe that a Dashboard could also be a valuable modality. A Dashboard would allow us to visualize the changes in real-time, showing how the new email field integrates with the existing Student entity and providing insights into the database migration process.

This could be particularly useful for stakeholders who want to see the impact of the changes at a glance. 

What do you think about the Dashboard option? Should we consider it alongside the Document format?

The Dashboard option does present a compelling case, especially for stakeholders who prefer visual insights and real-time data representation. It would allow us to showcase the integration of the new email field with the existing Student entity dynamically. 

However, I still believe that a Document format (.docx) would be essential for providing a detailed explanation of the changes, including the technical aspects of the database schema update and migration process. 

Perhaps we could consider a hybrid approach where we provide both a Document for detailed information and a Dashboard for visual representation. This way, we cater to different preferences among stakeholders.

What do you think about this hybrid approach? Or do you feel strongly about choosing one modality over the other?

The hybrid approach of combining both a Document format (.docx) for detailed explanations and a Dashboard for visual representation is an excellent idea.

By offering both modalities, we can enhance understanding and engagement with the updates made to the Student entity. 

If we are all in agreement on this hybrid approach, we can finalize our decision. What do you think? Shall we proceed with this plan?

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided does not fully meet the requirements of the task. Here are the detailed reviews based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Student` class is defined in `models.py`, but it is not imported in `main.py` or `database.py`. This will lead to issues when trying to interact with the `Student` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The `add_student` method in `main.py` only handles adding a student by name. It does not include the email field as required by the task.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: While there are some comments, the methods lack detailed comments explaining their functionality, especially for the new email field.

4. **No potential bugs**: There is a potential bug in the `add_student` method where it does not handle the email input. This could lead to data integrity issues.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not conform to the task as it does not include the email field in the `Student` entity or the GUI.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation does not allow users to input an email address when adding a student.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
The most critical issue is that the `Student` entity does not include the required email field, and the GUI does not allow for email input. This directly violates the task requirements.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Update the `Student` model** in `models.py` to include the email field:
   ```python
   email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Modify the `add_student` method** in `main.py` to include an email input field:
   ```python
   self.email_label = tk.Label(root, text="Student Email:")
   self.email_label.pack()
   self.email_entry = tk.Entry(root)
   self.email_entry.pack()
   ```

   Update the `add_student` method to send the email along with the name:
   ```python
   def add_student(self):
       name = self.name_entry.get()
       email = self.email_entry.get()
       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students", json={"name": name, "email": email})
       if response.status_code == 200:
           self.output_text.insert(tk.END, f"Added: {name}, Email: {email}\n")
       else:
           self.output_text.insert(tk.END, "Failed to add student\n")
   ```

3. **Update the database schema** in `database.py` to include a migration script that adds the email column while preserving existing data. You can use Alembic for migrations.

4. **Add comments** to all methods explaining their purpose and functionality.

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the requirements of the task and allow for proper user interaction.

### Final Instruction:
Please proceed to implement the suggested changes in the codebase to ensure compliance with the task requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided does not fully meet the requirements of the task. Here are the detailed reviews based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Student` class is defined in `models.py`, but it is not imported in `main.py` or `database.py`. This will lead to issues when trying to interact with the `Student` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The `add_student` method in `main.py` only handles adding a student by name. It does not include the email field as required by the task.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: While there are some comments, the methods lack detailed comments explaining their functionality, especially for the new email field.

4. **No potential bugs**: There is a potential bug in the `add_student` method where it does not handle the email input. This could lead to data integrity issues.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not conform to the task as it does not include the email field in the `Student` entity or the GUI.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation does not allow users to input an email address when adding a student.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
The most critical issue is that the `Student` entity does not include the required email field, and the GUI does not allow for email input. This directly violates the task requirements.

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Update the `Student` model** in `models.py` to include the email field:
   ```python
   email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Modify the `add_student` method** in `main.py` to include an email input field:
   ```python
   self.email_label = tk.Label(root, text="Student Email:")
   self.email_label.pack()
   self.email_entry = tk.Entry(root)
   self.email_entry.pack()
   ```

   Update the `add_student` method to send the email along with the name:
   ```python
   def add_student(self):
       name = self.name_entry.get()
       email = self.email_entry.get()
       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students", json={"name": name, "email": email})
       if response.status_code == 200:
           self.output_text.insert(tk.END, f"Added: {name}, Email: {email}\n")
       else:
           self.output_text.insert(tk.END, "Failed to add student\n")
   ```

3. **Update the database schema** in `database.py` to include a migration script that adds the email column while preserving existing data. You can use Alembic for migrations.

4. **Add comments** to all methods explaining their purpose and functionality.

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the requirements of the task and allow for proper user interaction.

### Final Instruction:
Please proceed to implement the suggested changes in the codebase to ensure compliance with the task requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

### Summary of Changes:
1. Added the `email` field to the `Student` model in `models.py`.
2. Updated the `add_student` method in `main.py` to include an email input field and send the email data to the server.
3. Included a migration script in `database.py` to add the email column while preserving existing data.
4. Updated the fetch method to display the email of each student.

These changes ensure that the application meets the requirements of the task and allows for proper user interaction.

Here are the detailed reviews based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: The Student class is defined in models.py, but it is not imported in main.py or database.py. This will lead to issues when trying to interact with the Student entity.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: The add_student method in main.py only handles adding a student by name. It does not include the email field as required by the task.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: While there are some comments, the methods lack detailed comments explaining their functionality, especially for the new email field.\n\n4. No potential bugs: There is a potential bug in the add_student method where it does not handle the email input. This could lead to data integrity issues.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The project does not conform to the task as it does not include the email field in the Student entity or the GUI.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: The current implementation does not allow users to input an email address when adding a student.\n\n### Comment with the Highest Priority:\nThe most critical issue is that the Student entity does not include the required email field, and the GUI does not allow for email input. This directly violates the task requirements.\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. Update the Student model in models.py to include the email field:\n   python\n   email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Modify the add_student method in main.py to include an email input field:\n   python\n   self.email_label = tk.Label(root, text="Student Email:")\n   self.email_label.pack()\n   self.email_entry = tk.Entry(root)\n   self.email_entry.pack()\n\n\n   Update the add_student method to send the email along with the name:\n   python\n   def add_student(self):\n       name = self.name_entry.get()\n       email = self.email_entry.get()\n       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students", json={"name": name, "email": email})\n       if response.status_code == 200:\n           self.output_text.insert(tk.END, f"Added: {name}, Email: {email}\\n")\n       else:\n           self.output_text.insert(tk.END, "Failed to add student\\n")\n\n\n3. Update the database schema in database.py to include a migration script that adds the email column while preserving existing data. You can use Alembic for migrations.\n\n4. Add comments to all methods explaining their purpose and functionality.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will meet the requirements of the task and allow for proper user interaction.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease proceed to implement the suggested changes in the codebase to ensure compliance with the task requirements.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity, but there are a few critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets all the regulations outlined.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The migration script in `database.py` does not include the necessary imports for the `sa` module (SQLAlchemy) and does not handle the migration context properly. This could lead to runtime errors when attempting to execute the migration.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Import the required SQLAlchemy module in the migration script:**
   Add the following import statement at the beginning of the `upgrade` and `downgrade` functions:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String
   ```

2. **Ensure the migration context is correctly set up:**
   The migration script should be executed within the context of Alembic. Ensure that the migration is properly set up in your Alembic environment.

Here is the corrected version of the migration script:

```python
# Migration script to add email column
def upgrade():
    from alembic import op
    import sqlalchemy as sa  # Importing sqlalchemy
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False))

def downgrade():
    from alembic import op
    op.drop_column('students', 'email')
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the email field is unique or indexed if necessary, depending on your application's requirements.
- Validate the email format in the `add_student` method to ensure that users enter a valid email address.

By implementing these changes, the code will be more robust and compliant with the requirements. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity, but there are a few critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets all the regulations outlined.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The migration script in `database.py` does not include the necessary imports for the `sa` module (SQLAlchemy) and does not handle the migration context properly. This could lead to runtime errors when attempting to execute the migration.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Import the required SQLAlchemy module in the migration script:**
   Add the following import statement at the beginning of the `upgrade` and `downgrade` functions:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String
   ```

2. **Ensure the migration context is correctly set up:**
   The migration script should be executed within the context of Alembic. Ensure that the migration is properly set up in your Alembic environment.

Here is the corrected version of the migration script:

```python
# Migration script to add email column
def upgrade():
    from alembic import op
    import sqlalchemy as sa  # Importing sqlalchemy
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False))

def downgrade():
    from alembic import op
    op.drop_column('students', 'email')
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the email field is unique or indexed if necessary, depending on your application's requirements.
- Validate the email format in the `add_student` method to ensure that users enter a valid email address.

By implementing these changes, the code will be more robust and compliant with the requirements. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Import the required SQLAlchemy module in the migration script:\n   Add the following import statement at the beginning of the upgrade and downgrade functions:\n   python\n   from sqlalchemy import Column, String\n\n\n2. Ensure the migration context is correctly set up:\n   The migration script should be executed within the context of Alembic. Ensure that the migration is properly set up in your Alembic environment.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the migration script:\n\npython\n# Migration script to add email column\ndef upgrade():\n    from alembic import op\n    import sqlalchemy as sa  # Importing sqlalchemy\n    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False))\n\ndef downgrade():\n    from alembic import op\n    op.drop_column('students', 'email')\n\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- Ensure that the email field is unique or indexed if necessary, depending on your application's requirements.\n- Validate the email format in the add_student method to ensure that users enter a valid email address.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will be more robust and compliant with the requirements. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements of adding an email field to the Student entity and updating the database schema accordingly. However, there are a few critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly and adheres to the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The migration script in `database.py` does not handle the preservation of existing Student data when adding the new email column. Since the email field is marked as required (nullable=False), existing records will cause the migration to fail if they do not have an email value.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Modify the Migration Script:**
   Update the migration script to add the email column as nullable initially, then populate it with default values (e.g., an empty string or a placeholder) for existing records, and finally alter the column to be non-nullable.

   Here’s how you can modify the `upgrade` function in `database.py`:

   ```python
   def upgrade():
       from alembic import op
       import sqlalchemy as sa
       
       # Step 1: Add email column as nullable
       op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))
       
       # Step 2: Update existing records to have a default email value
       connection = op.get_bind()
       connection.execute("UPDATE students SET email = '' WHERE email IS NULL")
       
       # Step 3: Alter the column to be non-nullable
       op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Ensure Email Validation Logic:**
   In `main.py`, the email validation logic is basic. Consider using a more robust validation method, such as using regular expressions, to ensure that the email format is valid before sending it to the server.

3. **Testing:**
   After making these changes, ensure to run tests to verify that the migration works correctly and that existing data is preserved. Also, test the application to confirm that the GUI behaves as expected when adding and fetching students.

By implementing these suggestions, the application will be more robust and compliant with the requirements set forth by the customer.

### Final Note:
Please ensure to back up the database before running migrations, especially when altering existing schemas.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements of adding an email field to the Student entity and updating the database schema accordingly. However, there are a few critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly and adheres to the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The migration script in `database.py` does not handle the preservation of existing Student data when adding the new email column. Since the email field is marked as required (nullable=False), existing records will cause the migration to fail if they do not have an email value.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Modify the Migration Script:**
   Update the migration script to add the email column as nullable initially, then populate it with default values (e.g., an empty string or a placeholder) for existing records, and finally alter the column to be non-nullable.

   Here’s how you can modify the `upgrade` function in `database.py`:

   ```python
   def upgrade():
       from alembic import op
       import sqlalchemy as sa
       
       # Step 1: Add email column as nullable
       op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))
       
       # Step 2: Update existing records to have a default email value
       connection = op.get_bind()
       connection.execute("UPDATE students SET email = '' WHERE email IS NULL")
       
       # Step 3: Alter the column to be non-nullable
       op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Ensure Email Validation Logic:**
   In `main.py`, the email validation logic is basic. Consider using a more robust validation method, such as using regular expressions, to ensure that the email format is valid before sending it to the server.

3. **Testing:**
   After making these changes, ensure to run tests to verify that the migration works correctly and that existing data is preserved. Also, test the application to confirm that the GUI behaves as expected when adding and fetching students.

By implementing these suggestions, the application will be more robust and compliant with the requirements set forth by the customer.

### Final Note:
Please ensure to back up the database before running migrations, especially when altering existing schemas.

Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes based on the comments provided, ensuring that the email field is added correctly to the Student entity while preserving existing data. The migration script has been updated to handle the addition of the email column properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code snippets and the libraries used in the project, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the Student Management application:

```plaintext
SQLAlchemy==1.4.27
alembic==1.7.7
requests==2.26.0
tkinter  # Note: tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to specify version
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **SQLAlchemy**: This is the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library used for database interactions.
- **alembic**: This is a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy.
- **requests**: This library is used for making HTTP requests to the FastAPI application.
- **tkinter**: This is the standard GUI toolkit for Python, which is typically included with Python installations, so it is not necessary to specify a version.

Make sure to install these dependencies in your Python environment using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

This will ensure that all the required packages are installed for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code snippets and the libraries used in the project, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the Student Management application:
```plaintext
SQLAlchemy==1.4.27
alembic==1.7.7
requests==2.26.0
tkinter  # Note: tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to specify version
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **SQLAlchemy**: This is the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library used for database interactions.
- **alembic**: This is a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy.
- **requests**: This library is used for making HTTP requests to the FastAPI application.
- **tkinter**: This is the standard GUI toolkit for Python, which is typically included with Python installations, so it is not necessary to specify a version.
Make sure to install these dependencies in your Python environment using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
This will ensure that all the required packages are installed for the project to run properly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Student Management Application

The Student Management Application is designed to help manage student records efficiently. It allows users to add students with their names and email addresses, as well as fetch and display the list of students.

## Main Functions

- **Add Student**: Users can input a student's name and email address to add them to the database.
- **Fetch Students**: Users can retrieve and display the list of all students stored in the database, including their names and email addresses.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   SQLAlchemy
   alembic
   requests
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Database Migration

Before running the application, ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new email field in the Student entity. You can use Alembic for this purpose:

1. **Run the Migration**:
   Make sure you have Alembic installed and then run the migration script:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application by executing the `main.py` file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Add a Student**:
   - Enter the student's name in the "Student Name" field.
   - Enter the student's email in the "Student Email" field.
   - Click the "Add Student" button to save the information.

3. **Fetch Students**:
   - Click the "Fetch Students" button to retrieve and display the list of all students in the application.

## Email Validation

The application includes basic email validation using regex to ensure that the email format is correct before adding a student.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter an error related to `tkinter`, ensure that it is installed. It is usually included with Python installations, but you can install it via your package manager if needed.
- If you face issues with database migrations, ensure that Alembic is properly configured and that you have run the migration commands.

## Conclusion

The Student Management Application provides a simple yet effective way to manage student records. By following the installation and usage instructions, you can easily set up and start using the application to manage your student data.
