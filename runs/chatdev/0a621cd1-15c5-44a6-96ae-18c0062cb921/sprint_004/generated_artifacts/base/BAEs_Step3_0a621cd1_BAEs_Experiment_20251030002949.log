To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we should consider the most effective product modality that can present the information clearly and efficiently. 

Given the nature of the task, which involves defining a new entity with specific fields, I believe a Document format could be beneficial. It allows for detailed descriptions and explanations of the Course entity, including the name and level fields, along with any additional context or requirements.

However, we could also consider a Dashboard format, which could visualize the Course data dynamically, especially if we anticipate needing to manage or display multiple courses in the future.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you have a preference for one modality over the other, or do you see another option that might be more suitable?

I appreciate your insights on the Document and Dashboard formats. While a Document would provide a clear and structured way to present the Course entity details, I believe a Dashboard could offer a more interactive and engaging way to visualize and manage the Course data, especially if we plan to expand the functionality in the future.

Additionally, a Dashboard could allow for real-time updates and insights, which could be valuable for the customer as they manage their courses. 

That said, if the primary goal is to simply define the Course entity without the need for interactivity, a Document might suffice. 

I would lean towards the Dashboard option for its potential to enhance user experience and future scalability. What do you think?

I agree with your perspective on the Dashboard format. Its interactive nature and ability to provide real-time insights would indeed enhance the user experience and offer scalability for future functionalities. Given that the customer may want to manage multiple courses and possibly visualize relationships or statistics related to them, a Dashboard would be a more forward-thinking choice.

While a Document could serve the immediate need, the Dashboard aligns better with our mission of creating engaging and innovative products. 

If we are all in agreement on the Dashboard as our final product modality, we can proceed to finalize this decision. Shall we confirm this?

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Code Review

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is essential for the implementation of the Course entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There are no methods for handling the Course entity (e.g., creating, retrieving courses). This needs to be added.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present in the existing methods, but new methods for the Course entity will also need comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code appears to be free of syntax errors, but without the Course entity, we cannot ensure the overall functionality.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The current implementation does not meet the user's requirement to create a Course entity.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI and API currently only handle Student entities. The user will not be able to interact with the Course entity without additional implementation.

### Highest Priority Comment

**Comment**: The Course entity is not implemented, which is a critical requirement of the task. 

### Suggestions for Revision

1. **Create the Course Model**: 
   - Add a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String
   from database import Base

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Course Schema**: 
   - Add a new schema for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel

   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str
   ```

3. **Implement Course Routes**: 
   - Add routes for creating and retrieving courses in `routes.py`:
   ```python
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=dict)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return {"id": db_course.id, "name": db_course.name, "level": db_course.level}

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list)
   def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": course.id, "name": course.name, "level": course.level} for course in courses]
   ```

4. **Update Database Migration**: 
   - Create a new migration script to add the Course table while preserving existing Student data.

5. **Update GUI**: 
   - Modify `gui.py` to include functionality for adding and viewing courses.

By implementing these changes, the software will meet the customer's requirements and allow for interaction with both Student and Course entities.

### Final Note
Please proceed with these changes to ensure the software is operable according to the user's requirements.

[2025-30-10 00:30:16 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ### Code Review

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is essential for the implementation of the Course entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There are no methods for handling the Course entity (e.g., creating, retrieving courses). This needs to be added.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present in the existing methods, but new methods for the Course entity will also need comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code appears to be free of syntax errors, but without the Course entity, we cannot ensure the overall functionality.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The current implementation does not meet the user's requirement to create a Course entity.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI and API currently only handle Student entities. The user will not be able to interact with the Course entity without additional implementation.

### Highest Priority Comment

**Comment**: The Course entity is not implemented, which is a critical requirement of the task. 

### Suggestions for Revision

1. **Create the Course Model**: 
   - Add a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String
   from database import Base

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Course Schema**: 
   - Add a new schema for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel

   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str
   ```

3. **Implement Course Routes**: 
   - Add routes for creating and retrieving courses in `routes.py`:
   ```python
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=dict)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return {"id": db_course.id, "name": db_course.name, "level": db_course.level}

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list)
   def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": course.id, "name": course.name, "level": course.level} for course in courses]
   ```

4. **Update Database Migration**: 
   - Create a new migration script to add the Course table while preserving existing Student data.

5. **Update GUI**: 
   - Modify `gui.py` to include functionality for adding and viewing courses.

By implementing these changes, the software will meet the customer's requirements and allow for interaction with both Student and Course entities.

### Final Note
Please proceed with these changes to ensure the software is operable according to the user's requirements.

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's request for creating a Course entity with the specified fields and updating the database schema while preserving existing Student data, I will modify the existing codebase accordingly. Below are the updated codes for each file, formatted as requested.

### models.py

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Script Revision Needed**: The migration script does not include a mechanism to preserve existing Student data during the upgrade process. While the script creates the new Course table, it is essential to ensure that the migration process does not inadvertently affect the existing Student data.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `migration_script.py`** to ensure that the upgrade process is safe and does not interfere with existing data. Although the current script does not drop any tables, it is good practice to ensure that the migration is explicitly safe.

Here’s the revised `migration_script.py`:

```python
'''
Migration script to add Course table and preserve existing Student data.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = 'xxxxxx'  # Replace with a unique revision ID
down_revision = None
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Ensure that existing Student data is preserved (this is implicit in the creation of a new table)

def downgrade():
    # Drop the courses table if needed
    op.drop_table('courses')
```

### Instructions for Fixing:
- Ensure that the migration script is executed properly using Alembic to create the Course table without affecting the existing Student table.
- Test the migration process in a development environment to confirm that existing Student data remains intact after the migration.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the software meets the requirements and operates correctly without losing any existing features.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Script Revision Needed**: The migration script does not include a mechanism to preserve existing Student data during the upgrade process. While the script creates the new Course table, it is essential to ensure that the migration process does not inadvertently affect the existing Student data.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `migration_script.py`** to ensure that the upgrade process is safe and does not interfere with existing data. Although the current script does not drop any tables, it is good practice to ensure that the migration is explicitly safe.

Here’s the revised `migration_script.py`:

```python
'''
Migration script to add Course table and preserve existing Student data.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = 'xxxxxx'  # Replace with a unique revision ID
down_revision = None
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Ensure that existing Student data is preserved (this is implicit in the creation of a new table)

def downgrade():
    # Drop the courses table if needed
    op.drop_table('courses')
```

### Instructions for Fixing:
- Ensure that the migration script is executed properly using Alembic to create the Course table without affecting the existing Student table.
- Test the migration process in a development environment to confirm that existing Student data remains intact after the migration.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the software meets the requirements and operates correctly without losing any existing features.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly according to the requirements.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
**Database Migration Script Revision**: The migration script does not include a proper revision ID, which is essential for Alembic to track the migration history. Additionally, the `down_revision` should reference the last migration if there are any existing migrations. This could lead to issues when running migrations in a production environment.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `migration_script.py`**:
   - Assign a unique revision ID to the `revision` variable.
   - If there are existing migrations, set the `down_revision` to the last migration ID. If this is the first migration, it can remain as `None`.

Here’s an example of how to revise the migration script:

```python
# migration_script.py
'''
Migration script to add Course table and preserve existing Student data.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '20231001_001'  # Replace with a unique revision ID
down_revision = None  # Set this to the last migration ID if applicable
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Ensure that existing Student data is preserved (this is implicit in the creation of a new table)

def downgrade():
    # Drop the courses table if needed
    op.drop_table('courses')
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that you run the migration script after making these changes to update the database schema correctly.
- Test the application thoroughly after the migration to confirm that both the Student and Course functionalities work as expected.

By addressing this issue, you will ensure that the migration process is reliable and maintainable, which is crucial for the long-term success of the application.

If you implement this change, the code will be compliant with the requirements and regulations set forth by ChatDev.

   - If there are existing migrations, set the `down_revision` to the last migration ID. If this is the first migration, it can remain as `None`.

Here’s an example of how to revise the migration script:

```python
# migration_script.py
'''
Migration script to add Course table and preserve existing Student data.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '20231001_001'  # Replace with a unique revision ID
down_revision = None  # Set this to the last migration ID if applicable
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    # Ensure that existing Student data is preserved (this is implicit in the creation of a new table)

def downgrade():
    # Drop the courses table if needed
    op.drop_table('courses')
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that you run the migration script after making these changes to update the database schema correctly.
- Test the application thoroughly after the migration to confirm that both the Student and Course functionalities work as expected.

By addressing this issue, you will ensure that the migration process is reliable and maintainable, which is crucial for the long-term success of the application.

If you implement this change, the code will be compliant with the requirements and regulations set forth by ChatDev.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Explanation:
- I added a check to ensure that the `tkinter` module is available before proceeding with the application. This prevents the `ModuleNotFoundError` from occurring if `tkinter` is not installed. If `tkinter` is not found, an informative error message is raised.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Explanation:
- The error reported was `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'`. This indicates that the Tkinter library is not installed in the environment where the application is being run. The code already includes a check for Tkinter's availability and raises an ImportError if it is not found. Therefore, no changes were necessary in the code itself, but the user must ensure that Tkinter is installed in their Python environment to avoid this error.

  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:

uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
requests==2.28.1
tkinter==0.1.0  # Note: Tkinter is included with Python's standard library, so this line is optional.
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: A lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy.
- **requests**: A simple HTTP library for making requests to the API from the GUI.
- **tkinter**: The standard GUI toolkit for Python (optional, as it is included with Python installations).

Make sure to adjust the versions as necessary based on your project's requirements or compatibility needs.

Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

# Student Management System

A simple application for managing students and courses using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and a FastAPI backend.

## Main Functions

The Student Management System allows users to:

- **Add Students**: Users can input student names and emails to create new student records.
- **View Students**: Users can retrieve and display a list of all registered students.
- **Add Courses**: Users can input course names and levels to create new course records.
- **View Courses**: Users can retrieve and display a list of all available courses.

## Installation

To set up the Student Management System, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-management-system.git
cd student-management-system
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy alembic requests
```

### Step 4: Create the Database

Run the following command to create the database and tables:

```bash
python -c "from database import create_database; create_database()"
```

### Step 5: Run the FastAPI Server

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Step 6: Run the GUI Application

In a new terminal window, ensure your virtual environment is activated and run:

```bash
python gui.py
```

The GUI application will open, allowing you to interact with the Student Management System.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Adding a Student**:
   - Enter the student's name and email in the respective fields.
   - Click the "Add Student" button to create a new student record.

2. **Viewing Students**:
   - Click the "View Students" button to display a list of all registered students.

3. **Adding a Course**:
   - Enter the course name and level in the respective fields.
   - Click the "Add Course" button to create a new course record.

4. **Viewing Courses**:
   - Click the "View Courses" button to display a list of all available courses.

## Additional Information

- The application uses SQLite as the database, and all data is stored in `students.db`.
- The backend is built using FastAPI, which provides a RESTful API for managing students and courses.
- The GUI is built using Tkinter, providing a simple interface for user interaction.

For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
