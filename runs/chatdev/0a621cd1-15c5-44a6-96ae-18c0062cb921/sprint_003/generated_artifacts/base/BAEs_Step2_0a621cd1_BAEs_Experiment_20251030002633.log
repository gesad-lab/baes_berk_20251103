To address the customer's task of adding an email field to the Student entity, we should consider how we want to present the information regarding this update. 

1. **Document**: This could be a straightforward way to outline the changes in a formal document format, detailing the new field and the migration process.

2. **PowerPoint**: If we want to present this information in a more visual format, a PowerPoint presentation could effectively communicate the changes to stakeholders.

3. **Dashboard**: If we want to visualize the impact of this change on student data, a dashboard could be useful to show how the email field integrates with existing data.

4. **Website**: A web-based presentation could allow for interactive exploration of the changes and how they fit into the overall system.

5. **Application**: If we want to create a tool that allows users to interact with the Student entity, an application could be a good fit.

What are your thoughts on which modality would best suit the customer's needs for this task?

I believe a **Document** would be the most appropriate modality for this task. It allows us to clearly outline the changes to the Student entity, including the new email field, the database schema updates, and the migration process while preserving existing data. This format is straightforward and can be easily shared with stakeholders for review.

I agree that a **Document** is a suitable choice for this task.

Additionally, it allows for detailed explanations and can serve as a reference for future discussions or implementations.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To address the customer's task of adding an email field to the Student entity, I will review the provided code against the regulations outlined.

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The necessary classes are imported in the relevant files, but the `email` field is not included in the `Student` model or the `StudentCreate` schema.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The methods in `routes.py` and `main.py` are implemented correctly, but they do not handle the email field.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present, but they need to be updated to reflect the new functionality.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code does not have bugs, but it lacks the implementation for the email field.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: Currently, it does not conform because the email field is missing.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The user will not be able to input or view the email field as it is not implemented.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the email field has not been added to the `Student` model and the `StudentCreate` schema, which is essential to fulfill the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `Student` model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = "students"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `StudentCreate` schema in `schemas.py`**:
   ```python
   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: str  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `create_student` method in `routes.py`**:
   ```python
   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Creates a new student.
       '''
       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)  # Update this line
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name, "email": db_student.email}  # Update this line
   ```

4. **Update the `view_students` method in `routes.py`**:
   ```python
   @router.get("/students/", response_model=list)
   def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Retrieves all students.
       '''
       students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": student.id, "name": student.name, "email": student.email} for student in students]  # Update this line
   ```

5. **Update the GUI in `main.py` to include email input**:
   ```python
   self.label_email = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Student Email:")
   self.label_email.pack()
   self.entry_email = tk.Entry(master)
   self.entry_email.pack()
   ```

   Update the `add_student` method to include email:
   ```python
   def add_student(self):
       name = self.entry.get()
       email = self.entry_email.get()
       if not name.strip() or not email.strip():  # Check for empty name or email
           self.output.insert(tk.END, "Error: Name and Email cannot be empty.\n")
           return
       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name, "email": email})  # Update this line
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will fulfill the customer's requirements and allow for proper interaction with the new email field.

### Summary:
The code requires modifications to include the email field in the Student entity, the creation process, and the GUI. Please implement the suggested changes to ensure compliance with the task requirements.

   ```

   Update the `add_student` method to include email:
   ```python
   def add_student(self):
       name = self.entry.get()
       email = self.entry_email.get()
       if not name.strip() or not email.strip():  # Check for empty name or email
           self.output.insert(tk.END, "Error: Name and Email cannot be empty.\n")
           return
       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name, "email": email})  # Update this line
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will fulfill the customer's requirements and allow for proper interaction with the new email field.

### Summary:
The code requires modifications to include the email field in the Student entity, the creation process, and the GUI. Please implement the suggested changes to ensure compliance with the task requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"To address the customer's task of adding an email field to the Student entity, I will review the provided code against the regulations outlined.

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The necessary classes are imported in the relevant files, but the `email` field is not included in the `Student` model or the `StudentCreate` schema.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The methods in `routes.py` and `main.py` are implemented correctly, but they do not handle the email field.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present, but they need to be updated to reflect the new functionality.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code does not have bugs, but it lacks the implementation for the email field.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: Currently, it does not conform because the email field is missing.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The user will not be able to input or view the email field as it is not implemented.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the email field has not been added to the `Student` model and the `StudentCreate` schema, which is essential to fulfill the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `Student` model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = "students"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `StudentCreate` schema in `schemas.py`**:
   ```python
   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: str  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `create_student` method in `routes.py`**:
   ```python
   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Creates a new student.
       '''
       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)  # Update this line
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name, "email": db_student.email}  # Update this line
   ```

4. **Update the `view_students` method in `routes.py`**:
   ```python
   @router.get("/students/", response_model=list)
   def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Retrieves all students.
       '''
       students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": student.id, "name": student.name, "email": student.email} for student in students]  # Update this line
   ```

5. **Update the GUI in `main.py` to include email input**:
   ```python
   self.label_email = tk.Label(master, text="Enter Student Email:")
   self.label_email.pack()
   self.entry_email = tk.Entry(master)
   self.entry_email.pack()
   ```

   Update the `add_student` method to include email:
   ```python
   def add_student(self):
       name = self.entry.get()
       email = self.entry_email.get()
       if not name.strip() or not email.strip():  # Check for empty name or email
           self.output.insert(tk.END, "Error: Name and Email cannot be empty.\n")
           return
       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name, "email": email})  # Update this line
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will fulfill the customer's requirements and allow for proper interaction with the new email field.

### Summary:
The code requires modifications to include the email field in the Student entity, the creation process, and the GUI. Please implement the suggested changes to ensure compliance with the task requirements."

[2025-30-10 00:27:25 INFO] Programmer: **Programmer<->Code Reviewer on : CodeReviewModification, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes for the project, incorporating the email field into the Student entity and updating the necessary components accordingly.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the overall robustness of the application.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration for Existing Data**: The current implementation does not include a database migration script to add the new email column to the existing Student table while preserving existing data. This is crucial to ensure that the application continues to function correctly without data loss.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Migration Script**: You need to create a migration script that alters the existing Student table to add the email column. If you are using a migration tool like Alembic, you can generate a migration script that adds the email column to the existing table.

   Here’s an example of how you might write a migration script using Alembic:

   ```python
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
   revision = 'xxxxxx'  # Replace with a unique revision ID
   down_revision = None
   branch_labels = None
   depends_on = None

   def upgrade():
       # Add the email column to the students table
       op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False))

   def downgrade():
       # Remove the email column if needed
       op.drop_column('students', 'email')
   ```

2. **Run the Migration**: After creating the migration script, run the migration to apply the changes to the database schema.

3. **Testing**: Ensure to test the application after the migration to verify that existing data is preserved and that the application behaves as expected with the new email field.

By implementing the above suggestions, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements and functions correctly without losing any existing data.

### Additional Note:
Make sure to handle any potential exceptions that may arise during database operations, such as when adding a student with an existing email or when the database connection fails.

### Conclusion:
Implement the migration script and run it to ensure the email field is added correctly while preserving existing data. This is critical for maintaining the integrity of the application.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the migration process, feel free to ask!

[2025-30-10 00:27:35 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the overall robustness of the application.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration for Existing Data**: The current implementation does not include a database migration script to add the new email column to the existing Student table while preserving existing data. This is crucial to ensure that the application continues to function correctly without data loss.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding an email field to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the overall robustness of the application.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration for Existing Data**: The current implementation does not include a database migration script to add the new email column to the existing Student table while preserving existing data. This is crucial to ensure that the application continues to function correctly without data loss.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Migration Script**: You need to create a migration script that alters the existing Student table to add the email column. If you are using a migration tool like Alembic, you can generate a migration script that adds the email column to the existing table.

   Here’s an example of how you might write a migration script using Alembic:

   ```python
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
   revision = 'xxxxxx'  # Replace with a unique revision ID
   down_revision = None
   branch_labels = None
   depends_on = None

   def upgrade():
       # Add the email column to the students table
       op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False))

   def downgrade():
       # Remove the email column if needed
       op.drop_column('students', 'email')
   ```

2. **Run the Migration**: After creating the migration script, run the migration to apply the changes to the database schema.

3. **Testing**: Ensure to test the application after the migration to verify that existing data is preserved and that the application behaves as expected with the new email field.

By implementing the above suggestions, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements and functions correctly without losing any existing data.

### Additional Note:
Make sure to handle any potential exceptions that may arise during database operations, such as when adding a student with an existing email or when the database connection fails.

### Conclusion:
Implement the migration script and run it to ensure the email field is added correctly while preserving existing data. This is critical for maintaining the integrity of the application.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the migration process, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

This is crucial to ensure that the application continues to function correctly without data loss.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Create a Migration Script: You need to create a migration script that alters the existing Student table to add the email column. If you are using a migration tool like Alembic, you can generate a migration script that adds the email column to the existing table.\n\n   Here’s an example of how you might write a migration script using Alembic:\n\n   python\n   from alembic import op\n   import sqlalchemy as sa\n\n   # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.\n   revision = 'xxxxxx'  # Replace with a unique revision ID\n   down_revision = None\n   branch_labels = None\n   depends_on = None\n\n   def upgrade():\n       # Add the email column to the students table\n       op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False))\n\n   def downgrade():\n       # Remove the email column if needed\n       op.drop_column('students', 'email')\n\n\n2. Run the Migration: After creating the migration script, run the migration to apply the changes to the database schema.\n\n3. Testing: Ensure to test the application after the migration to verify that existing data is preserved and that the application behaves as expected with the new email field.\n\nBy implementing the above suggestions, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements and functions correctly without losing any existing data.\n\n### Additional Note:\nMake sure to handle any potential exceptions that may arise during database operations, such as when adding a student with an existing email or when the database connection fails.\n\n### Conclusion:\nImplement the migration script and run it to ensure the email field is added correctly while preserving existing data. This is critical for maintaining the integrity of the application.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with the migration process, feel free to ask!"} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly and meets the requirements.

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `migration_script.py` does not include a mechanism to preserve existing Student data during the migration process. While the `upgrade()` function adds the new `email` column, it does not handle existing records that may not have an email value, which could lead to data integrity issues.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Modify the `upgrade()` function in `migration_script.py` to set a default value for existing records.** This can be done by using a SQL command to update existing records after adding the new column. For example, you could set the default value to an empty string or `NULL` if allowed.

Here’s how you can modify the `upgrade()` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add the email column to the students table
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))  # Allow NULL temporarily
    # Update existing records to set a default value for the new email column
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = '' WHERE email IS NULL")  # Set default value
    # Alter the column to make it required
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
```

2. **Ensure that the `nullable` property is set to `True` when adding the column initially, and then change it to `False` after populating existing records.** This prevents any issues with existing records that do not have an email value.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration script preserves existing Student data and complies with the requirements.

Please proceed with these modifications to ensure the application operates smoothly without data loss during the migration process.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly and meets the requirements.

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `migration_script.py` does not include a mechanism to preserve existing Student data during the migration process. While the `upgrade()` function adds the new `email` column, it does not handle existing records that may not have an email value, which could lead to data integrity issues.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Modify the `upgrade()` function in `migration_script.py` to set a default value for existing records.** This can be done by using a SQL command to update existing records after adding the new column. For example, you could set the default value to an empty string or `NULL` if allowed.

Here’s how you can modify the `upgrade()` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add the email column to the students table
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))  # Allow NULL temporarily
    # Update existing records to set a default value for the new email column
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = '' WHERE email IS NULL")  # Set default value
    # Alter the column to make it required
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
```

2. **Ensure that the `nullable` property is set to `True` when adding the column initially, and then change it to `False` after populating existing records.** This prevents any issues with existing records that do not have an email value.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration script preserves existing Student data and complies with the requirements.

Please proceed with these modifications to ensure the application operates smoothly without data loss during the migration process."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Explanation:
- I added an import check for `tkinter` to ensure that the program does not crash if `tkinter` is not installed. If `tkinter` is not found, the program will print an error message and exit gracefully. This addresses the `ModuleNotFoundError` reported in the test summary.

### Explanation:
- I added an import check for `tkinter` to ensure that the program does not crash if `tkinter` is not installed. If `tkinter` is not found, the program will print an error message and exit gracefully. This addresses the `ModuleNotFoundError` reported in the test summary.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Add email field to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add email field to the existing Student entity:
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the email field
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Explanation:
- The error reported was a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `tkinter`. This indicates that the `tkinter` library is not installed in the environment. The code already includes a check for this and exits with an error message if `tkinter` is not found. Therefore, no changes were needed in the code itself, as it handles the error gracefully.
- The rest of the code is functioning as intended and does not require modifications based on the error summary provided.

### Explanation:
- The import statement for `tkinter` is retained, but an additional check is added to ensure that the `tkinter` module is available. If it is not installed, an `ImportError` is raised with a clear message. This ensures that the application fails gracefully if `tkinter` is not present, providing the user with guidance on how to resolve the issue.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Student Management Application

A simple application for managing student records, including adding and viewing student information.

## Main Functions

- **Add Student**: Allows users to enter a student's name and email address, which are then stored in the database.
- **View Students**: Displays a list of all students along with their IDs and email addresses.

## Installation

To run the Student Management Application, you need to set up your environment and install the required dependencies. Follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd student_app
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip. You can create a virtual environment to keep your dependencies organized:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi sqlalchemy pydantic requests alembic
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Database

Before running the application, you need to create the database and tables. You can do this by running the following command in a Python shell:

```python
from database import create_database
create_database()
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

Start the FastAPI server by running the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Step 5: Run the GUI

To run the graphical user interface (GUI), execute the following command:

```bash
python gui.py
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Adding a Student**:
   - Open the GUI.
   - Enter the student's name in the "Enter Student Name" field.
   - Enter the student's email in the "Enter Student Email" field.
   - Click the "Add Student" button to save the information.
   - If successful, a confirmation message will appear.
