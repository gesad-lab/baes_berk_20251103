To address the new customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be a **Dashboard**, which would allow us to visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time. This could provide insights into student enrollment, course popularity, and other metrics that could be beneficial for the customer.

Alternatively, a **Document** could be useful for providing a detailed explanation of the new relationship, including the database schema changes and migration strategy. This would be more focused on documentation rather than visualization.

We could also consider an **Application** that allows users to interact with the Student and Course entities, perhaps through a user interface that displays the relationships dynamically.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the potential product modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic and visual representation of the relationships, which could be very engaging for users and help them analyze data effectively. 

On the other hand, a **Document** would serve as a comprehensive guide, detailing the technical aspects of the changes, which is crucial for understanding the implementation.

An **Application** could also be a strong choice, as it would allow for user interaction and practical demonstration of the new relationships.

Considering the customer's needs, I believe a **Dashboard** might be the most effective way to present the information visually and interactively, while still allowing for some documentation to accompany it.

What do you think? Should we lean towards the Dashboard, or do you feel another option is more suitable?

I agree that a **Dashboard** would be the most effective choice for this task. It allows for a visual and interactive representation of the relationships between students and courses, which can enhance user engagement and provide valuable insights. 

While documentation is important, the dynamic nature of a Dashboard can help users better understand the data and relationships at a glance. Additionally, we can always provide supplementary documentation to explain the technical details and implementation.

Given our discussion and the consensus on the benefits of a Dashboard, I believe we should proceed with this modality. 

Are we ready to finalize our decision?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, I have reviewed the provided code in detail according to the regulations set by ChatDev. Here are my findings:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The necessary classes from `models.py` (i.e., `Student` and `Course`) are imported in `routes.py`, which is correct.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The methods for creating and retrieving students and courses are implemented correctly.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present, but they could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of each function.

4. **No potential bugs**: The code appears to be free of syntax errors or bugs at first glance.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The code does not currently implement the relationship between `Student` and `Course`. This is the most critical issue.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The GUI does not allow for the interaction of students with courses, which is a significant gap in fulfilling the requirement.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
The most critical issue is that the relationship between `Student` and `Course` has not been implemented. The `Student` model needs to be updated to include a relationship to the `Course` model, and the relevant database schema must be modified accordingly.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py`** to establish a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`. This can be done using an association table.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship('Course', secondary=student_courses, back_populates='students')

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship('Student', secondary=student_courses, back_populates='courses')
```

2. **Update the `schemas.py`** to include course information in the `StudentResponse` schema.

```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: list[CourseResponse]  # Add this line to include courses
```

3. **Update the `routes.py`** to handle adding courses to a student and retrieving a student's courses.

```python
@student_router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def add_course_to_student(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(student)
    return student
```

4. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database schema is updated to reflect these changes. You will need to create a new migration script using Alembic to add the `student_courses` table.

5. **Update the GUI**: Modify the GUI to allow users to assign courses to students.

By implementing these changes, the software will meet the customer's requirements and allow students to have courses associated with them.

### Final Note:
Please ensure to run the Alembic migration after making these changes to preserve existing data and update the schema accordingly.

The most critical issue is that the relationship between `Student` and `Course` has not been implemented. The `Student` model needs to be updated to include a relationship to the `Course` model, and the relevant database schema must be modified accordingly.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py`** to establish a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`. This can be done using an association table.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship('Course', secondary=student_courses, back_populates='students')

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship('Student', secondary=student_courses, back_populates='courses')
```

2. **Update the `schemas.py`** to include course information in the `StudentResponse` schema.

```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: list[CourseResponse]  # Add this line to include courses
```

3. **Update the `routes.py`** to handle adding courses to a student and retrieving a student's courses.

```python
@student_router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def add_course_to_student(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(student)
    return student
```

4. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database schema is updated to reflect these changes. You will need to create a new migration script using Alembic to add the `student_courses` table.

5. **Update the GUI**: Modify the GUI to allow users to assign courses to students.

By implementing these changes, the software will meet the customer's requirements and allow students to have courses associated with them.

### Final Note:
Please ensure to run the Alembic migration after making these changes to preserve existing data and update the schema accordingly.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, we will modify the existing code to include a many-to-many relationship. This will allow a student to enroll in multiple courses and a course to have multiple students. We will also ensure that the database schema is updated accordingly and that existing data is preserved during migration.

Here are the modifications made to the code:

1. **Update the `models.py` file** to include a relationship between `Student` and `Course` using an association table.
2. **Update the `schemas.py` file** to include course enrollment in the student response.
3. **Update the `routes.py` file** to handle course enrollment for students.
4. **Add a migration script** to update the database schema without losing existing data.

Here are the updated codes:

### alembic migration script
You will need to create a migration script to add the `student_courses` association table. This can be done using Alembic commands. Here’s a basic example of what the migration script might look like:

```python
'''
Migration script to add student_courses association table.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = 'add_student_courses_table'
down_revision = None
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('student_courses')
```

### Note
Make sure to run the Alembic migration after creating the migration script to apply the changes to the database schema.

With these changes, the application now supports a many-to-many relationship between students and courses, allowing students to enroll in multiple courses while preserving existing data during migration.

[2025-30-10 22:03:01 INFO] flask app.py did not start for online log
[2025-30-10 22:03:01 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To fulfill the customer's requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, we will modify the existing code to include a many-to-many relationship. This will allow a student to enroll in multiple courses and a course to have multiple students. We will also ensure that the database schema is updated accordingly and that existing data is preserved during migration.

Here are the modifications made to the code:

1. **Update the `models.py` file** to include a relationship between `Student` and `Course` using an association table.
2. **Update the `schemas.py` file** to include course enrollment in the student response.
3. **Update the `routes.py` file** to handle course enrollment for students.
4. **Add a migration script** to update the database schema without losing existing data.

Here are the updated codes:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements of adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Course Enrollment in Student Response:**
The `StudentResponse` schema currently only returns a list of course IDs (`courses: List[int]`), but it would be more informative to return the full course details (like name and level) instead of just IDs. This would enhance the user experience when fetching student data.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `StudentResponse` schema** to include a list of courses with their details:
   ```python
   class CourseDetail(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

   class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str
       courses: List[CourseDetail]  # Change to include course details
   ```

2. **Modify the `get_students` endpoint** to return the full course details:
   ```python
   @student_router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
   def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       students = db.query(Student).options(joinedload(Student.courses)).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return students
   ```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the `enroll_student_in_course` method handles cases where a student is already enrolled in a course to avoid duplicate entries in the `student_courses` association table.
- Consider adding error handling for database operations to provide more informative responses in case of failures.

By implementing these changes, the software will provide a more comprehensive view of the student's enrolled courses, enhancing usability and meeting the requirements more effectively.

If you implement these suggestions, the code will be more robust and user-friendly.

[2025-30-10 22:03:11 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements of adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Course Enrollment in Student Response:**
The `StudentResponse` schema currently only returns a list of course IDs (`courses: List[int]`), but it would be more informative to return the full course details (like name and level) instead of just IDs. This would enhance the user experience when fetching student data.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `StudentResponse` schema** to include a list of courses with their details:
   ```python
   class CourseDetail(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

   class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str
       courses: List[CourseDetail]  # Change to include course details
   ```

2. **Modify the `get_students` endpoint** to return the full course details:
   ```python
   @student_router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
   def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       students = db.query(Student).options(joinedload(Student.courses)).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return students
   ```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the `enroll_student_in_course` method handles cases where a student is already enrolled in a course to avoid duplicate entries in the `student_courses` association table.
- Consider adding error handling for database operations to provide more informative responses in case of failures.

By implementing these changes, the software will provide a more comprehensive view of the student's enrolled courses, enhancing usability and meeting the requirements more effectively.

If you implement these suggestions, the code will be more robust and user-friendly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes according to the requirements of the new user's task, ensuring that the relationship between the Student and Course entities is properly established and that the database migration preserves existing data.

These modifications ensure that the Student entity can have a relationship with the Course entity, and the database schema is updated accordingly while preserving existing data.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a course relationship to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `courses` field in the `StudentResponse` schema should return a list of course objects or names instead of just course IDs. This would provide more meaningful information to the API consumers.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `StudentResponse` schema** to include a list of course details instead of just IDs. Modify the `StudentResponse` class in `schemas.py` as follows:

```python
class CourseDetail(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str

class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: List[CourseDetail]  # Change to return course details instead of IDs
```

2. **Update the `enroll_student_in_course` function** in `routes.py` to return the full course details when fetching a student:

```python
@student_router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return [
        {
            "id": student.id,
            "name": student.name,
            "email": student.email,
            "courses": [{"id": course.id, "name": course.name, "level": course.level} for course in student.courses]
        }
        for student in students
    ]
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that the `gui.py` file is updated to allow users to enroll students in courses through the GUI if that feature is required.
- Consider adding error handling for the `enroll_student_in_course` function to manage cases where a student is already enrolled in a course.

By implementing these changes, the API will provide more useful information to the users, thus improving the overall usability of the software.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know!

This would provide more meaningful information to the API consumers.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Update the StudentResponse schema to include a list of course details instead of just IDs. Modify the StudentResponse class in schemas.py as follows:\n\npython\nclass CourseDetail(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    level: str\n\nclass StudentResponse(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    email: str\n    courses: List[CourseDetail]  # Change to return course details instead of IDs\n\n\n2. Update the enroll_student_in_course function in routes.py to return the full course details when fetching a student:\n\npython\n@student_router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])\ndef get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()\n    return [\n        {\n            "id": student.id,\n            "name": student.name,\n            "email": student.email,\n            "courses": [{"id": course.id, "name": course.name, "level": course.level} for course in student.courses]\n        }\n        for student in students\n    ]\n\n\n### Additional Suggestions:\n- Ensure that the gui.py file is updated to allow users to enroll students in courses through the GUI if that feature is required.\n- Consider adding error handling for the enroll_student_in_course function to manage cases where a student is already enrolled in a course.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the API will provide more useful information to the users, thus improving the overall usability of the software.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know!'} |

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a course relationship to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `courses` field in the `StudentResponse` schema should return a list of course objects or names instead of just course IDs. This would provide more meaningful information to the API consumers.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `StudentResponse` schema** to include a list of course details instead of just IDs. Modify the `StudentResponse` class in `schemas.py` as follows:

```python
class CourseDetail(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str

class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: List[CourseDetail]  # Change to return course details instead of IDs
```

2. **Update the `enroll_student_in_course` function** in `routes.py` to return the full course details when fetching a student:

```python
@student_router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return [
        {
            "id": student.id,
            "name": student.name,
            "email": student.email,
            "courses": [{"id": course.id, "name": course.name, "level": course.level} for course in student.courses]
        }
        for student in students
    ]
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that the `gui.py` file is updated to allow users to enroll students in courses through the GUI if that feature is required.
- Consider adding error handling for the `enroll_student_in_course` function to manage cases where a student is already enrolled in a course.

By implementing these changes, the API will provide more useful information to the users, thus improving the overall usability of the software.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes based on the comments provided. The changes include updating the `StudentResponse` schema to return course details instead of just IDs and modifying the `get_students` function to reflect these changes.

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, the following `requirements.txt` file can be created to specify the necessary dependencies for the project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2

```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: The migration tool for handling database schema changes.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI for API calls.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers if you want to use different versions or if there are newer releases available.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
