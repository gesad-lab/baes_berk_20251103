To address the customer's task of creating a Teacher entity, we need to consider how best to present the information related to this new entity. 

One option could be to use a **Document** format, which would allow us to provide a detailed description of the Teacher entity, including the name and email fields, along with any additional context or instructions for implementation.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Dashboard** format, which would allow us to visualize the Teacher entity alongside existing Student and Course data, providing a more interactive experience for the user.

Another possibility is to use a **Website** format, which could serve as a dedicated page for the Teacher entity, allowing for easy access and updates in the future.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the various product modalities. 

Using a **Document** format is a solid choice for providing detailed specifications, but it may lack interactivity and visual representation of the data.

The **Dashboard** format could be very effective, as it allows for real-time visualization and interaction with the Teacher entity alongside existing data, which could enhance user experience.

The **Website** format also has its merits, especially for future updates and accessibility, but it may require more development effort compared to the other options.

Considering the need for clarity and potential future interactions with the Teacher entity, I lean towards the **Dashboard** format as it provides a comprehensive view while allowing for easy integration with existing data.

What do you think?

I agree with your assessment of the **Dashboard** format. It not only allows for real-time visualization but also provides an interactive experience that can enhance user engagement. Additionally, integrating the Teacher entity with existing Student and Course data in a dashboard can offer valuable insights and facilitate better management of educational resources.

The **Dashboard** format seems to strike the right balance between clarity, interactivity, and future scalability. 

If we are in agreement on this, we can finalize our decision. Shall we proceed?

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured, but it lacks the implementation of the new `Teacher` entity as per the customer's requirements. Here are the detailed checks against the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model is not defined or imported anywhere in the provided code.
2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods related to the `Teacher` entity.
3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are missing for the new methods that need to be implemented for the `Teacher` entity.
4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code does not have bugs, but the absence of the `Teacher` entity means the application won't function as required.
5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not conform to the user's task as the `Teacher` entity is missing.
6. **User interaction with generated software**: Without the `Teacher` entity, the user cannot interact with the software as intended.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The code is missing the implementation of the `Teacher` entity, which is crucial for fulfilling the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create the Teacher Model**: Add a new model for `Teacher` in `models.py`.
2. **Create a Migration Script**: Add a new migration script to create the `teachers` table in the database.
3. **Update the Schemas**: Create Pydantic schemas for the `Teacher` entity in `schemas.py`.
4. **Implement CRUD Operations**: Add endpoints in `main.py` to create and read `Teacher` entities.

### Example Code for Teacher Implementation:

**models.py**
```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)

[2025-30-10 13:20:14 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided is mostly well-structured, but it lacks the implementation of the new `Teacher` entity as per the customer's requirements. Here are the detailed checks against the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model is not defined or imported anywhere in the provided code.
2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods related to the `Teacher` entity.
3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are missing for the new methods that need to be implemented for the `Teacher` entity.
4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code does not have bugs, but the absence of the `Teacher` entity means the application won't function as required.
5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not conform to the user's task as the `Teacher` entity is missing.
6. **User interaction with generated software**: Without the `Teacher` entity, the user cannot interact with the software as intended.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The code is missing the implementation of the `Teacher` entity, which is crucial for fulfilling the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create the Teacher Model**: Add a new model for `Teacher` in `models.py`.
2. **Create a Migration Script**: Add a new migration script to create the `teachers` table in the database.
3. **Update the Schemas**: Create Pydantic schemas for the `Teacher` entity in `schemas.py`.
4. **Implement CRUD Operations**: Add endpoints in `main.py` to create and read `Teacher` entities.

### Example Code for Teacher Implementation:

**models.py**
```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

**xxxx_add_teacher.py** (new migration script)
```python
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

revision = '20231001_add_teacher'  # Example revision ID
down_revision = '20231001_add_student_courses'  # Replace with the actual last migration ID

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('teachers')
```

**schemas.py**
```python
class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr

class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

**main.py**
```python
@app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
    db.add(db_teacher)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_teacher)
    return db_teacher

@app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])
def read_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return teachers
```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements and allow for interaction with the `Teacher` entity.

FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's request for creating a Teacher entity with name and email fields, updating the database schema, and ensuring that existing Student and Course data is preserved, I will modify the existing codebase accordingly. Below are the updated files with the necessary changes.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for creating a Teacher entity and updating the database schema. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `xxxx_add_teacher.py` migration script has a hardcoded revision ID and down_revision that may not align with the actual migration history. This could lead to migration conflicts or failures when applied.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `down_revision`**: Ensure that the `down_revision` in `xxxx_add_teacher.py` accurately reflects the last migration ID from which this migration is being created. This should be the ID of the last migration that was successfully applied before this one.

2. **Use a consistent naming convention**: Consider renaming the migration files to follow a consistent naming convention that includes timestamps or sequential numbers to avoid confusion.

3. **Add comments**: Ensure that all methods in the migration script have comments explaining their purpose, especially in the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` methods.

4. **Run migrations**: After making the changes, run the migrations to ensure that they apply correctly without errors and that existing data in the Student and Course tables is preserved.

### Example of Updated Migration Script:
```python
'''
Migration script to add the Teacher table.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '20231001_add_teacher'  # Update this to a unique revision ID
down_revision = '20231001_add_student_courses'  # Ensure this matches the last applied migration ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None
def upgrade():
    """Create the Teacher table in the database."""
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
def downgrade():
    """Drop the Teacher table from the database."""
    op.drop_table('teachers')
```

### Final Instructions:
- Verify the last migration ID and update the `down_revision` accordingly.
- Ensure that all migration scripts are tested in a development environment before deployment.
- Document any changes made to the migration scripts for future reference.

By addressing these points, the code will be more robust and maintainable, ensuring that the application functions as intended without losing any features.

This could lead to migration conflicts or failures when applied.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Update the down_revision: Ensure that the down_revision in xxxx_add_teacher.py accurately reflects the last migration ID from which this migration is being created. This should be the ID of the last migration that was successfully applied before this one.\n\n2. Use a consistent naming convention: Consider renaming the migration files to follow a consistent naming convention that includes timestamps or sequential numbers to avoid confusion.\n\n3. Add comments: Ensure that all methods in the migration script have comments explaining their purpose, especially in the upgrade() and downgrade() methods.\n\n4. Run migrations*: After making the changes, run the migrations to ensure that they apply correctly without errors and that existing data in the Student and Course tables is preserved.\n\n### Example of Updated Migration Script:\npython\n\'\'\'\nMigration script to add the Teacher table.\n\'\'\'\nfrom alembic import op\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\n# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.\nrevision = \'20231001_add_teacher\'  # Update this to a unique revision ID\ndown_revision = \'20231001_add_student_courses\'  # Ensure this matches the last applied migration ID\nbranch_labels = None\ndepends_on = None\ndef upgrade():\n    """Create the Teacher table in the database."""\n    op.create_table(\n        \'teachers\',\n        sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column(\'email\', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n    )\ndef downgrade():\n    """Drop the Teacher table from the database."""\n    op.drop_table(\'teachers\')\n\n\n### Final Instructions:\n- Verify the last migration ID and update the down_revision accordingly.\n- Ensure that all migration scripts are tested in a development environment before deployment.\n- Document any changes made to the migration scripts for future reference.\n\nBy addressing these points, the code will be more robust and maintainable, ensuring that the application functions as intended without losing any features.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements for creating a Teacher entity and updating the database schema. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `xxxx_add_teacher.py` migration script has a hardcoded revision ID and down_revision that may not align with the actual migration history. This could lead to migration conflicts or failures when applied.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `down_revision`**: Ensure that the `down_revision` in `xxxx_add_teacher.py` accurately reflects the last migration ID from which this migration is being created. This should be the ID of the last migration that was successfully applied before this one.

2. **Use a consistent naming convention**: Consider renaming the migration files to follow a consistent naming convention that includes timestamps or sequential numbers to avoid confusion.

3. **Add comments**: Ensure that all methods in the migration script have comments explaining their purpose, especially in the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` methods.

4. **Run migrations**: After making the changes, run the migrations to ensure that they apply correctly without errors and that existing data in the Student and Course tables is preserved.

### Example of Updated Migration Script:
```python
'''
Migration script to add the Teacher table.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '20231001_add_teacher'  # Update this to a unique revision ID
down_revision = '20231001_add_student_courses'  # Ensure this matches the last applied migration ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None
def upgrade():
    """Create the Teacher table in the database."""
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
def downgrade():
    """Drop the Teacher table from the database."""
    op.drop_table('teachers')
```

### Final Instructions:
- Verify the last migration ID and update the `down_revision` accordingly.
- Ensure that all migration scripts are tested in a development environment before deployment.
- Document any changes made to the migration scripts for future reference.

By addressing these points, the code will be more robust and maintainable, ensuring that the application functions as intended without losing any features."

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Update the down_revision: Ensure that the down_revision in xxxx_add_teacher.py accurately reflects the last migration ID from which this migration is being created. This should be the ID of the last migration that was successfully applied before this one.\n\n2. Use a consistent naming convention: Consider renaming the migration files to follow a consistent naming convention that includes timestamps or sequential numbers to avoid confusion.\n\n3. Add comments: Ensure that all methods in the migration script have comments explaining their purpose, especially in the upgrade() and downgrade() methods.\n\n4. Run migrations*: After making the changes, run the migrations to ensure that they apply correctly without errors and that existing data in the Student and Course tables is preserved.\n\n### Example of Updated Migration Script:\npython\n\'\'\'\nMigration script to add the Teacher table.\n\'\'\'\nfrom alembic import op\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\n# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.\nrevision = \'20231001_add_teacher\'  # Update this to a unique revision ID\ndown_revision = \'20231001_add_student_courses\'  # Ensure this matches the last applied migration ID\nbranch_labels = None\ndepends_on = None\ndef upgrade():\n    """Create the Teacher table in the database."""\n    op.create_table(\n        \'teachers\',\n        sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column(\'email\', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n    )\ndef downgrade():\n    """Drop the Teacher table from the database."""\n    op.drop_table(\'teachers\')\n\n\n### Final Instructions:\n- Verify the last migration ID and update the down_revision accordingly.\n- Ensure that all migration scripts are tested in a development environment before deployment.\n- Document any changes made to the migration scripts for future reference.\n\nBy addressing these points, the code will be more robust and maintainable, ensuring that the application functions as intended without losing any features.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Migration Script Order and Revision ID:**
The migration script `xxxx_add_teacher.py` has a `down_revision` that references `20231001_add_student_courses`, which is correct. However, the `revision` ID should be unique and follow the proper sequence. If there are multiple migration scripts, ensure that the revision IDs are incremented correctly to avoid conflicts.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `revision` ID in `xxxx_add_teacher.py`:**
   Change the `revision` ID to a unique identifier that follows the last applied migration. For example, if the last migration ID was `20231001_add_student_courses`, you could set the new revision to `20231002_add_teacher`.

   ```python
   # Update this to a unique revision ID
   revision = '20231002_add_teacher'  # Ensure this is unique and follows the last migration
   ```

2. **Ensure Migration Order:**
   Make sure that the migration scripts are executed in the correct order. If there are any other migration scripts that need to be applied before adding the Teacher table, ensure they are correctly sequenced.

3. **Run Migrations:**
   After updating the migration script, run the migrations to ensure that the Teacher table is created without affecting existing Student and Course data.

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that the database connection string in `database.py` is correctly configured for your environment.
- Test the API endpoints for creating and retrieving teachers to confirm that they work as expected.

By addressing the migration script order and ensuring unique revision IDs, you will maintain the integrity of the database schema and ensure smooth migrations.

If you implement these changes, the code should be ready for deployment.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Teacher Management System

A comprehensive application for managing teachers, students, and courses.

## Overview

The Teacher Management System allows users to create, read, and manage data related to teachers, students, and courses. This application is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, providing a robust and efficient way to handle educational data.

## Main Functions

- **Manage Teachers**: Create and retrieve teacher records with essential details such as name and email.
- **Manage Students**: Create and retrieve student records, including their associated courses.
- **Manage Courses**: Create and retrieve course records, detailing course names and levels.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure that you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   fastapi
   sqlalchemy
   alembic
   pydantic
   uvicorn
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To start the FastAPI application, run the following command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the interactive API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### API Endpoints

#### Teacher Management

- **Create a Teacher**:
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /teachers/`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: Returns the created teacher object.

- **Retrieve Teachers**:
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /teachers/`
  - **Response**: Returns a list of all teachers.

#### Student Management
