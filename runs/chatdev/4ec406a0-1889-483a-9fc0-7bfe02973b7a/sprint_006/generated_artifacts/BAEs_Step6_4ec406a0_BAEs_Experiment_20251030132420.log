To address the customer's task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be to use a **Document** format, where we can provide detailed documentation on the database schema changes, including the relationship between Course and Teacher entities. This would allow for clear explanations and diagrams.

Alternatively, a **Dashboard** could be beneficial, as it would allow us to visualize the relationships in real-time and provide an interactive experience for users to explore the data.

We could also consider a **Website** format, which would allow us to present the information in a more engaging way, potentially including interactive elements and visualizations.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you have a preference or any additional ideas?

I appreciate your insights on the various options. 

A **Document** would provide a thorough and structured explanation of the changes, which is essential for clarity, especially for technical stakeholders. 

On the other hand, a **Dashboard** could offer a dynamic view of the relationships and allow users to interact with the data, which could be very useful for understanding the impact of the new relationship in real-time.

The **Website** option would also allow us to present the information in a user-friendly manner, potentially reaching a broader audience and providing a more engaging experience.

Considering the nature of the task, I lean towards the **Document** format for its clarity and comprehensiveness. However, I see the value in the other options as well. 

What do you think? Should we prioritize clarity with a Document, or do you feel that an interactive approach like a Dashboard or Website would be more beneficial?

I understand your perspective on prioritizing clarity with a Document, especially given the technical nature of the task. A Document would indeed provide a comprehensive overview of the changes, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the modifications to the database schema and the new relationship between Course and Teacher entities.

However, I also see the merit in the Dashboard option, as it would allow users to visualize the relationships dynamically and interact with the data, which could enhance understanding and engagement.

Ultimately, I believe that while clarity is crucial, providing an interactive experience could also add significant value. If we can find a way to combine the strengths of both a Document and a Dashboard, we might be able to satisfy both needs.

That said, if we must choose one modality, I would lean towards the Document for its structured approach. How do you feel about this compromise? Should we finalize the Document as our product modality?

I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of both options. I agree that a Document provides the clarity and structured approach necessary for this technical task, especially for stakeholders who need to understand the database schema changes in detail.

While the Dashboard offers interactivity and visualization, the primary goal here is to ensure that the relationship between Course and Teacher entities is well-documented and easily understood. 

Given our discussion and the importance of clarity in this context, I believe we should finalize the Document as our product modality.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities. The `Course` model does not currently have a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model, which is essential to fulfill the requirement of establishing a relationship where a course can have a teacher.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `Course` model is missing a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model, which is necessary to establish the relationship between the two entities. This needs to be added to ensure that each course can be associated with a teacher.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py` to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model:**

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

2. **Update the `CourseCreate` schema in `schemas.py` to include an optional `teacher_id` field:**

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int = None  # Add this line to allow specifying a teacher when creating a course
```

3. **Update the `create_course` endpoint in `main.py` to handle the `teacher_id`:**

```python
@app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line
    db.add(db_course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_course)
    return db_course
```

4. **Create a new migration script to update the database schema:**

```python
'''
Migration script to add teacher_id to Course table.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

revision = '20231001_add_teacher_relationship'  # Update this to a unique revision ID
down_revision = '20231001_add_teacher'  # Ensure this matches the last applied migration ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    """Add teacher_id column to the Course table."""
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id')))

def downgrade():
    """Remove teacher_id column from the Course table."""
    op.drop_column('courses', 'teacher_id')
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher` will be established correctly, fulfilling the customer's requirements. Please proceed with these modifications to ensure the software operates as intended.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities. The `Course` model does not currently have a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model, which is essential to fulfill the requirement of establishing a relationship where a course can have a teacher.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `Course` model is missing a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model, which is necessary to establish the relationship between the two entities. This needs to be added to ensure that each course can be associated with a teacher.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py` to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model:**

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

2. **Update the `CourseCreate` schema in `schemas.py` to include an optional `teacher_id` field:**

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int = None  # Add this line to allow specifying a teacher when creating a course
```

3. **Update the `create_course` endpoint in `main.py` to handle the `teacher_id`:**

```python
@app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line
    db.add(db_course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_course)
    return db_course
```

4. **Create a new migration script to update the database schema:**

```python
'''
Migration script to add teacher_id to Course table.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

revision = '20231001_add_teacher_relationship'  # Update this to a unique revision ID
down_revision = '20231001_add_teacher'  # Ensure this matches the last applied migration ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    """Add teacher_id column to the Course table."""
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id')))

def downgrade():
    """Remove teacher_id column from the Course table."""
    op.drop_column('courses', 'teacher_id')
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher` will be established correctly, fulfilling the customer's requirements. Please proceed with these modifications to ensure the software operates as intended.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here is my detailed assessment:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py`, the `sa` module is imported, but it would be beneficial to ensure that all necessary classes are imported explicitly. However, this is not a critical issue since `sa` is already imported.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented correctly across the files.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present and adequately describe the functionality of each method.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, the migration scripts should ensure that existing data is preserved during the addition of new columns.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity is addressed, but the migration script `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` does not include a mechanism to preserve existing data when adding the `teacher_id` column. This could lead to issues if the column is added without a default value or if existing courses are not assigned a teacher.

6. **User interaction with the generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The code allows for interaction with the Course and Teacher entities, but the implementation of the relationship in the database schema should ensure that it does not disrupt existing functionality.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` needs to be revised to ensure that the addition of the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table does not disrupt existing data. Specifically, it should include a default value or handle existing records appropriately.

### Suggested Revision:
In the `upgrade()` method of `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py`, modify the `add_column` line to include a default value for `teacher_id` or ensure that it allows NULL values:

```python
def upgrade():
    """Add teacher_id column to the Course table."""
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))  # Allow NULL values for existing records
```

This change will ensure that existing courses do not encounter issues when the new column is added, thus preserving data integrity.

### Instructions:
1. Update the `upgrade()` method in `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` as suggested above.
2. Test the migration to ensure that existing data is preserved and that the application functions correctly after the migration.

By implementing this change, the code will better adhere to the requirements and ensure a smooth user experience.

Here is my detailed assessment:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - In xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py, the sa module is imported, but it would be beneficial to ensure that all necessary classes are imported explicitly. However, this is not a critical issue since sa is already imported.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - All methods are implemented correctly across the files.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - Comments are present and adequately describe the functionality of each method.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, the migration scripts should ensure that existing data is preserved during the addition of new columns.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity is addressed, but the migration script xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py does not include a mechanism to preserve existing data when adding the teacher_id column. This could lead to issues if the column is added without a default value or if existing courses are not assigned a teacher.\n\n6. User interaction with the generated software without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - The code allows for interaction with the Course and Teacher entities, but the implementation of the relationship in the database schema should ensure that it does not disrupt existing functionality.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe migration script xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py needs to be revised to ensure that the addition of the teacher_id column to the courses table does not disrupt existing data. Specifically, it should include a default value or handle existing records appropriately.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\nIn the upgrade() method of xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py, modify the add_column line to include a default value for teacher_id or ensure that it allows NULL values:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    """Add teacher_id column to the Course table."""\n    op.add_column(\'courses\', sa.Column(\'teacher_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'teachers.id\'), nullable=True))  # Allow NULL values for existing records\n\n\nThis change will ensure that existing courses do not encounter issues when the new column is added, thus preserving data integrity.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Update the upgrade() method in xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py as suggested above.\n2. Test the migration to ensure that existing data is preserved and that the application functions correctly after the migration.\n\nBy implementing this change, the code will better adhere to the requirements and ensure a smooth user experience.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here is my detailed assessment:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py`, the `sa` module is imported, but it would be beneficial to ensure that all necessary classes are imported explicitly. However, this is not a critical issue since `sa` is already imported.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented correctly across the files.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present and adequately describe the functionality of each method.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, the migration scripts should ensure that existing data is preserved during the addition of new columns.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity is addressed, but the migration script `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` does not include a mechanism to preserve existing data when adding the `teacher_id` column. This could lead to issues if the column is added without a default value or if existing courses are not assigned a teacher.

6. **User interaction with the generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The code allows for interaction with the Course and Teacher entities, but the implementation of the relationship in the database schema should ensure that it does not disrupt existing functionality.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` needs to be revised to ensure that the addition of the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table does not disrupt existing data. Specifically, it should include a default value or handle existing records appropriately.

### Suggested Revision:
In the `upgrade()` method of `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py`, modify the `add_column` line to include a default value for `teacher_id` or ensure that it allows NULL values:

```python
def upgrade():
    """Add teacher_id column to the Course table."""
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))  # Allow NULL values for existing records
```

This change will ensure that existing courses do not encounter issues when the new column is added, thus preserving data integrity.

### Instructions:
1. Update the `upgrade()` method in `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` as suggested above.
2. Test the migration to ensure that existing data is preserved and that the application functions correctly after the migration.

By implementing this change, the code will better adhere to the requirements and ensure a smooth user experience."

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - In xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py, the sa module is imported, but it would be beneficial to ensure that all necessary classes are imported explicitly. However, this is not a critical issue since sa is already imported.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - All methods are implemented correctly across the files.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - Comments are present and adequately describe the functionality of each method.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, the migration scripts should ensure that existing data is preserved during the addition of new columns.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity is addressed, but the migration script xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py does not include a mechanism to preserve existing data when adding the teacher_id column. This could lead to issues if the column is added without a default value or if existing courses are not assigned a teacher.\n\n6. User interaction with the generated software without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - The code allows for interaction with the Course and Teacher entities, but the implementation of the relationship in the database schema should ensure that it does not disrupt existing functionality.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe migration script xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py needs to be revised to ensure that the addition of the teacher_id column to the courses table does not disrupt existing data. Specifically, it should include a default value or handle existing records appropriately.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\nIn the upgrade() method of xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py, modify the add_column line to include a default value for teacher_id or ensure that it allows NULL values:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    """Add teacher_id column to the Course table."""\n    op.add_column(\'courses\', sa.Column(\'teacher_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'teachers.id\'), nullable=True))  # Allow NULL values for existing records\n\n\nThis change will ensure that existing courses do not encounter issues when the new column is added, thus preserving data integrity.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Update the upgrade() method in xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py as suggested above.\n2. Test the migration to ensure that existing data is preserved and that the application functions correctly after the migration.\n\nBy implementing this change, the code will better adhere to the requirements and ensure a smooth user experience.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` is incorrectly structured. The `upgrade()` method is attempting to add a `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table, but this column is already defined in the `models.py` file within the `Course` class. This redundancy can lead to confusion and potential migration errors.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Remove the `xxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` migration script** since the `teacher_id` column is already included in the `Course` model. The relationship is established in the `models.py` file, and the database schema should reflect this without needing an additional migration for the same column.

2. **Ensure that the existing migration scripts are executed in the correct order** to maintain data integrity. The `xxxx_add_teacher.py` migration should be applied before any operations that depend on the `teachers` table.

3. **Update the `xxxx_add_teacher.py` migration script** to include the `teacher_id` column in the `courses` table if it is not already present in the database schema. This can be done by modifying the `upgrade()` method to include the addition of the `teacher_id` column if it does not exist.

### Example of Updated Migration Script:
```python
def upgrade():
    """Create the Teacher table in the database and add teacher_id to Course table if not exists."""
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))  # Add this line
```

### Additional Note:
After making these changes, ensure to run the migrations again to verify that the database schema is correctly updated without losing any existing data.

By addressing this redundancy and ensuring the migration scripts are correctly structured, the software will be more robust and maintainable.

If you implement these suggestions, the code will align with the requirements and regulations set forth by ChatDev.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
