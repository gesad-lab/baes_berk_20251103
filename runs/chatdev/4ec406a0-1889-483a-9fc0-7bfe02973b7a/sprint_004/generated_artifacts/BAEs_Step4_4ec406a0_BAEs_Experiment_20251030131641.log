To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be to use a **Dashboard**, as it would allow us to visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time, providing insights into enrollment, course loads, and other metrics. 

Alternatively, we could consider a **Document** format, which would allow us to provide detailed documentation on the new relationship, including schema changes and migration strategies.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you have a preference for a specific modality?

I appreciate your suggestions. A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic and interactive way to visualize the relationship between students and courses, which could be beneficial for both administrators and users. It would allow for real-time updates and insights into student enrollment and course management.

On the other hand, a **Document** could serve as a comprehensive guide, detailing the implementation process, database schema changes, and migration strategies. This would be useful for technical teams who need to understand the specifics of the changes being made.

Considering the nature of the task, I lean towards the **Dashboard** modality, as it aligns well with our goal of providing a user-friendly interface for managing student-course relationships. 

What do you think? Should we proceed with the Dashboard, or do you have any other preferences?

I agree that a **Dashboard** would be the most effective modality for this task. It not only provides a visual representation of the relationships between students and courses but also allows for real-time interaction and updates, which can enhance user experience and decision-making. 

Given the dynamic nature of course enrollment and management, a Dashboard would be more beneficial than a static Document. 

If we are both in agreement, we can finalize our decision. Shall we proceed with the Dashboard?

The code provided does not currently implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. To fulfill the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the `Student` entity, we need to make several modifications to the existing code.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `Student` entity needs a many-to-many relationship with the `Course` entity, which is not currently implemented. This relationship should be established using an association table.**

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Create an Association Table:**
   We need to create a new table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

   Update `models.py` as follows:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
   from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

   # Association table for the many-to-many relationship
   student_courses = Table(
       'student_courses',
       Base.metadata,
       Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
       Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
   )

   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'students'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Added email field
       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
   ```

2. **Update the Schemas:**
   Modify the `schemas.py` to include courses in the `StudentResponse` model.

   Update `schemas.py` as follows:
   ```python
   from typing import List

   class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str  # Added email field to response
       courses: List[CourseResponse] = []  # Include courses in the response
   ```

3. **Update the Create Student Endpoint:**
   Modify the `create_student` function in `main.py` to accept courses when creating a student.

   Update `main.py` as follows:
   ```python
   @app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, course_ids: List[int] = [], db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)
       db_student.courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id.in_(course_ids)).all()  # Link courses
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return db_student
   ```

4. **Database Migration:**
   Ensure that the database migration preserves existing data. If you are using Alembic for migrations, create a new migration script to add the `student_courses` table.

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, we will establish the required relationship between `Student` and `Course`, allowing students to have courses while preserving existing data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to meet the customer's requirements effectively.

       Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
       Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
   )

       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")

       email: str  # Added email field to response
       courses: List[CourseResponse] = []  # Include courses in the response
   ```

   Modify the `create_student` function in `main.py` to accept courses when creating a student.

   Update `main.py` as follows:
   ```python
   @app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, course_ids: List[int] = [], db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)
       db_student.courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id.in_(course_ids)).all()  # Link courses
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return db_student
   ```

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided does not currently implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. To fulfill the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the `Student` entity, we need to make several modifications to the existing code.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `Student` entity needs a many-to-many relationship with the `Course` entity, which is not currently implemented. This relationship should be established using an association table.**

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Create an Association Table:**
   We need to create a new table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

   Update `models.py` as follows:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
   from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

   # Association table for the many-to-many relationship
   student_courses = Table(
       'student_courses',
       Base.metadata,
       Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
       Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
   )

   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'students'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Added email field
       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
   ```

2. **Update the Schemas:**
   Modify the `schemas.py` to include courses in the `StudentResponse` model.

   Update `schemas.py` as follows:
   ```python
   from typing import List

   class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str  # Added email field to response
       courses: List[CourseResponse] = []  # Include courses in the response
   ```

3. **Update the Create Student Endpoint:**
   Modify the `create_student` function in `main.py` to accept courses when creating a student.

   Update `main.py` as follows:
   ```python
   @app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, course_ids: List[int] = [], db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)
       db_student.courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id.in_(course_ids)).all()  # Link courses
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return db_student
   ```

4. **Database Migration:**
   Ensure that the database migration preserves existing data. If you are using Alembic for migrations, create a new migration script to add the `student_courses` table.

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, we will establish the required relationship between `Student` and `Course`, allowing students to have courses while preserving existing data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to meet the customer's requirements effectively."

### Conclusion
The above modifications implement the required many-to-many relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, allowing students to have courses while preserving existing data. The `StudentResponse` schema now includes a list of course IDs, and the `create_student` endpoint has been updated to accept course IDs when creating a student.

Update the Schemas:\n   Modify the schemas.py to include courses in the StudentResponse model.\n\n   Update schemas.py as follows:\n   python\n   from typing import List\n\n   class StudentResponse(BaseModel):\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       email: str  # Added email field to response\n       courses: List[CourseResponse] = []  # Include courses in the response\n\n\n3. Update the Create Student Endpoint:\n   Modify the create_student function in main.py to accept courses when creating a student.\n\n   Update main.py as follows:\n   python\n   @app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)\n   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, course_ids: List[int] = [], db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)\n       db_student.courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id.in_(course_ids)).all()  # Link courses\n       db.add(db_student)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_student)\n       return db_student\n\n\n4. Database Migration:\n   Ensure that the database migration preserves existing data. If you are using Alembic for migrations, create a new migration script to add the student_courses table.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy implementing these changes, we will establish the required relationship between Student and Course, allowing students to have courses while preserving existing data. \n\nPlease proceed with these revisions to meet the customer\'s requirements effectively.'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, and it appears to be well-structured. However, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration and the preservation of existing data, which is essential for the task at hand.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
**Database Migration Handling**: The current implementation does not include any specific migration handling to ensure that existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved when adding the new many-to-many relationship. This could lead to data loss or corruption if the database schema is altered without proper migration scripts.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement Database Migration**: Use a migration tool like Alembic to manage schema changes. This will allow you to create migration scripts that can be run to update the database schema without losing existing data.
   
   - Install Alembic:
     ```bash
     pip install alembic
     ```

   - Initialize Alembic in your project:
     ```bash
     alembic init alembic
     ```

   - Create a migration script that adds the `student_courses` association table and updates the existing `students` and `courses` tables as needed.

2. **Create Migration Script**: After initializing Alembic, create a migration script that includes the following:
   ```python
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
   revision = 'your_revision_id'
   down_revision = None
   branch_labels = None
   depends_on = None

   def upgrade():
       # Create the association table
       op.create_table(
           'student_courses',
           sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
           sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['student_id'], ['students.id'], ),
           sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['course_id'], ['courses.id'], ),
           sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('student_id', 'course_id')
       )

   def downgrade():
       # Drop the association table
       op.drop_table('student_courses')
   ```

3. **Run Migrations**: After creating the migration script, run the migrations to update the database schema:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database schema is updated correctly while preserving existing data, thus fulfilling the customer's requirements effectively.

### Summary:
To summarize, the highest priority issue is the lack of database migration handling, which is critical for preserving existing data. Implementing Alembic for migrations will address this concern and ensure a smooth transition to the new schema.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the migration process, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, and it appears to be well-structured. However, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration and the preservation of existing data, which is essential for the task at hand.

### Comment with Highest Priority:
**Database Migration Handling**: The current implementation does not include any specific migration handling to ensure that existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved when adding the new many-to-many relationship. This could lead to data loss or corruption if the database schema is altered without proper migration scripts.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement Database Migration**: Use a migration tool like Alembic to manage schema changes. This will allow you to create migration scripts that can be run to update the database schema without losing existing data.
   
   - Install Alembic:
     ```bash
     pip install alembic
     ```

   - Initialize Alembic in your project:
     ```bash
     alembic init alembic
     ```

   - Create a migration script that adds the `student_courses` association table and updates the existing `students` and `courses` tables as needed.

2. **Create Migration Script**: After initializing Alembic, create a migration script that includes the following:
   ```python
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
   revision = 'your_revision_id'
   down_revision = None
   branch_labels = None
   depends_on = None

   def upgrade():
       # Create the association table
       op.create_table(
           'student_courses',
           sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
           sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['student_id'], ['students.id'], ),
           sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['course_id'], ['courses.id'], ),
           sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('student_id', 'course_id')
       )

   def downgrade():
       # Drop the association table
       op.drop_table('student_courses')
   ```

3. **Run Migrations**: After creating the migration script, run the migrations to update the database schema:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database schema is updated correctly while preserving existing data, thus fulfilling the customer's requirements effectively.

### Summary:
To summarize, the highest priority issue is the lack of database migration handling, which is critical for preserving existing data. Implementing Alembic for migrations will address this concern and ensure a smooth transition to the new schema.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the migration process, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

However, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration and the preservation of existing data, which is essential for the task at hand.\n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nDatabase Migration Handling: The current implementation does not include any specific migration handling to ensure that existing data in the students and courses tables is preserved when adding the new many-to-many relationship. This could lead to data loss or corruption if the database schema is altered without proper migration scripts.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Implement Database Migration: Use a migration tool like Alembic to manage schema changes. This will allow you to create migration scripts that can be run to update the database schema without losing existing data.\n   \n   - Install Alembic:\n     bash\n     pip install alembic\n\n\n   - Initialize Alembic in your project:\n     bash\n     alembic init alembic\n\n\n   - Create a migration script that adds the student_courses association table and updates the existing students and courses tables as needed.\n\n2. Create Migration Script: After initializing Alembic, create a migration script that includes the following:\n   python\n   from alembic import op\n   import sqlalchemy as sa\n\n   # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.\n   revision = 'your_revision_id'\n   down_revision = None\n   branch_labels = None\n   depends_on = None\n\n   def upgrade():\n       # Create the association table\n       op.create_table(\n           'student_courses',\n           sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),\n           sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),\n           sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['student_id'], ['students.id'], ),\n           sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['course_id'], ['courses.id'], ),\n           sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('student_id', 'course_id')\n       )\n\n   def downgrade():\n       # Drop the association table\n       op.drop_table('student_courses')\n\n\n3. Run Migrations: After creating the migration script, run the migrations to update the database schema:\n   bash\n   alembic upgrade head\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database schema is updated correctly while preserving existing data, thus fulfilling the customer's requirements effectively.\n\n### Summary:\nTo summarize, the highest priority issue is the lack of database migration handling, which is critical for preserving existing data.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a course relationship to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The migration script `xxxx_add_student_courses.py` is missing a proper revision identifier and the `down_revision` is set to `None`, which could lead to issues when running migrations in a production environment. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Set a Proper Revision ID:** Update the `revision` variable with a unique identifier (e.g., a UUID or a sequential number) to ensure that it can be tracked properly.
2. **Set the Down Revision Correctly:** If this migration is not the first one, ensure that the `down_revision` is set to the last migration's revision ID to maintain the migration history.

### Example Revision:
```python
# xxxx_add_student_courses.py
'''
Migration script to add the student_courses association table.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '20231001_add_student_courses'  # Example revision ID
down_revision = 'previous_revision_id'  # Replace with the actual last migration ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None
def upgrade():
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['student_id'], ['students.id'], ),
        sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['course_id'], ['courses.id'], ),
        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('student_id', 'course_id')
    )
def downgrade():
    # Drop the association table
    op.drop_table('student_courses')
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the `previous_revision_id` is replaced with the actual ID of the last migration to maintain the integrity of the migration history.
- After making these changes, run the migration to verify that it works as expected without any issues.

By addressing this comment, the migration process will be more robust and maintainable. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a course relationship to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The migration script `xxxx_add_student_courses.py` is missing a proper revision identifier and the `down_revision` is set to `None`, which could lead to issues when running migrations in a production environment. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Set a Proper Revision ID:** Update the `revision` variable with a unique identifier (e.g., a UUID or a sequential number) to ensure that it can be tracked properly.
2. **Set the Down Revision Correctly:** If this migration is not the first one, ensure that the `down_revision` is set to the last migration's revision ID to maintain the migration history.

### Example Revision:
```python
# xxxx_add_student_courses.py
'''
Migration script to add the student_courses association table.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '20231001_add_student_courses'  # Example revision ID
down_revision = 'previous_revision_id'  # Replace with the actual last migration ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None
def upgrade():
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['student_id'], ['students.id'], ),
        sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['course_id'], ['courses.id'], ),
        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('student_id', 'course_id')
    )
def downgrade():
    # Drop the association table
    op.drop_table('student_courses')
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the `previous_revision_id` is replaced with the actual ID of the last migration to maintain the integrity of the migration history.
- After making these changes, run the migration to verify that it works as expected without any issues.

By addressing this comment, the migration process will be more robust and maintainable.

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in the project, the `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary dependencies for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic, among others. Here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file for your project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: The migration tool for SQLAlchemy, used to manage database schema changes.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers if you want to use specific versions or if there are newer versions available. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Environment Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for the application:

- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.

- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: The migration tool for SQLAlchemy, used to manage database schema changes.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers in `requirements.txt` if you want to use specific versions or if there are newer versions available.

## Database Migration

To set up the database schema and add the necessary relationships, run the following command:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

This command will apply the latest migrations, including the creation of the `student_courses` association table, which establishes the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.
