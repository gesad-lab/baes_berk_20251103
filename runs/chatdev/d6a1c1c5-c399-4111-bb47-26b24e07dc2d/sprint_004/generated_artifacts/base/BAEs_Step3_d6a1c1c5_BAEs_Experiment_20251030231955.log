To satisfy the new customer's demand for creating a Course entity, we should consider the best product modality that can effectively present the information related to the Course, such as its name and level. 

Given the simplicity of the data structure, a Document format could be suitable for presenting the Course entity in a clear and organized manner. However, if we want to provide a more interactive experience, a Website could also be a good choice, allowing users to view and potentially interact with the Course information.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you think a different modality might be more appropriate?

I agree that both Document and Website formats have their merits. A Document would provide a straightforward and professional presentation of the Course entity, making it easy to share and print. On the other hand, a Website would allow for a more dynamic and interactive experience, which could be beneficial if the customer wants to expand on the Course entity in the future or integrate it with other functionalities.

Considering the potential for future enhancements and user interaction, I lean towards the Website modality. However, if the customer prefers a more static presentation, the Document format could still be a viable option.

What do you think about prioritizing the Website format for its flexibility and interactivity?

I agree with your assessment that the Website format offers greater flexibility and interactivity, which could enhance the user experience and allow for future expansions. Given that the customer may want to build upon the Course entity later, prioritizing the Website modality seems like a strategic choice.

Additionally, a Website can easily incorporate additional features, such as user feedback, course enrollment options, and integration with other educational tools, which could be valuable for the customer.

Shall we finalize our decision to go with the Website format?

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Code Review

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model is not defined or imported in the provided code. This is essential for fulfilling the task requirements.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - There are no methods implemented for creating or retrieving courses. We need to add these methods to handle the Course entity.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for the Course entity will also need comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code appears to be free from bugs, but without the Course entity, we cannot fully assess the potential for bugs related to the new functionality.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The current code does not conform to the user's task as it lacks the Course entity and related functionality.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The current implementation does not allow for any interaction with the Course entity, which is a requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment
The highest priority comment is that the `Course` entity is missing from the implementation. To fulfill the customer's requirements, we need to create a new model for the Course entity, add routes for creating and retrieving courses, and ensure that the database schema is updated accordingly.

### Suggested Revisions
1. **Create a Course model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a new Pydantic schema for Course in `schemas.py`**:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str
   ```

3. **Add routes for Course in `routes.py`**:
   ```python
   from models import Course  # Import the Course model
   from schemas import CourseCreate  # Import the new CourseCreate schema

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=dict)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return {"id": db_course.id, "name": db_course.name, "level": db_course.level}

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list)
   def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": course.id, "name": course.name, "level": course.level} for course in courses]
   ```

4. **Update the `init_db` function in `database.py` to create the Course table**:
   ```python
   def init_db() -> None:
       Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # This will create both Student and Course tables
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating and managing Course entities while preserving existing Student data.

### Final Note
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's needs.

       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return {"id": db_course.id, "name": db_course.name, "level": db_course.level}

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list)
   def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": course.id, "name": course.name, "level": course.level} for course in courses]
   ```

4. **Update the `init_db` function in `database.py` to create the Course table**:
   ```python
   def init_db() -> None:
       Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # This will create both Student and Course tables
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating and managing Course entities while preserving existing Student data.

These modifications include the creation of the `Course` entity with the required fields, the addition of corresponding routes for creating and retrieving courses, and the necessary updates to the database schema. The existing `Student` data will remain intact during the migration process.

[2025-30-10 23:21:06 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To fulfill the customer's request, we need to create a new `Course` entity with the specified fields and update the database schema accordingly. Additionally, we will ensure that the existing `Student` data is preserved during the migration. Below are the modified codes for each file, formatted as per your requirements.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:

  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have assessed it against the regulations outlined. Here are my findings:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: All necessary classes are imported correctly.
2. **All methods should be implemented**: All methods are implemented as required.
3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present, but they could be more descriptive, especially for the new `create_course` and `get_courses` methods.
4. **No potential bugs**: The code appears to be free of syntax errors and logical bugs.
5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project meets the requirements specified by the user.
6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The code allows for user interaction as intended.

**Highest Priority Comment**: While the code is functional, the comments in the `routes.py` file for the `create_course` and `get_courses` methods could be improved for clarity. Clearer comments would enhance maintainability and understanding for future developers.

**Suggestions for Revision**:
- Update the comments in `routes.py` for the `create_course` and `get_courses` methods to provide more context about their functionality. For example:

```python
@router.post("/courses/", response_model=dict)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """
    Create a new course with the provided name and level.
    This endpoint requires a CourseCreate object containing the course details.
    """
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
    db.add(db_course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_course)
    return {"id": db_course.id, "name": db_course.name, "level": db_course.level}

@router.get("/courses/", response_model=list)
def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """
    Retrieve a list of courses with pagination support.
    This endpoint returns a list of courses, skipping the first 'skip' entries
    and limiting the results to 'limit' entries.
    """
    courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return [{"id": course.id, "name": course.name, "level": course.level} for course in courses]
```

This will improve the clarity of the code and assist future developers in understanding the purpose of each method.

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration process that needs to be addressed to ensure that existing Student data is preserved when adding the new Course table.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `init_db()` function in `database.py` creates the database schema but does not handle migrations. If the database already exists and the `create_all()` method is called, it will not alter existing tables or data. This could lead to a situation where the new Course table is not created properly if the database already exists, potentially causing data loss or corruption.

### Suggested Revision:
To ensure that the migration preserves existing Student data and properly adds the Course table, consider using a migration tool like Alembic. Here’s how to implement this:

1. **Install Alembic**:
   ```bash
   pip install alembic
   ```

2. **Initialize Alembic**:
   Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   ```

3. **Configure Alembic**:
   Update the `alembic.ini` file to point to your database URL:
   ```ini
   sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///./students.db
   ```

4. **Create Migration Script**:
   Generate a migration script after modifying your models:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add Course table"
   ```

5. **Apply Migration**:
   Run the migration to apply changes to the database:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

6. **Update `init_db()`**:
   Remove the `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` line from `init_db()` and replace it with a call to Alembic to handle migrations.

### Example of Updated `init_db()`:
```python
def init_db() -> None:
    from alembic import command
    from alembic.config import Config

    alembic_cfg = Config("alembic.ini")
    command.upgrade(alembic_cfg, "head")
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing Alembic for database migrations, you ensure that the existing Student data is preserved while adding the new Course table. This approach adheres to best practices for database management and will prevent potential data loss.

Please proceed with these changes to ensure the application meets the requirements effectively.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration process that needs to be addressed to ensure that existing Student data is preserved when adding the new Course table.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `init_db()` function in `database.py` creates the database schema but does not handle migrations. If the database already exists and the `create_all()` method is called, it will not alter existing tables or data. This could lead to a situation where the new Course table is not created properly if the database already exists, potentially causing data loss or corruption.

### Suggested Revision:
To ensure that the migration preserves existing Student data and properly adds the Course table, consider using a migration tool like Alembic. Here’s how to implement this:

1. **Install Alembic**:
   ```bash
   pip install alembic
   ```

2. **Initialize Alembic**:
   Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   ```

3. **Configure Alembic**:
   Update the `alembic.ini` file to point to your database URL:
   ```ini
   sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///./students.db
   ```

4. **Create Migration Script**:
   Generate a migration script after modifying your models:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add Course table"
   ```

5. **Apply Migration**:
   Run the migration to apply changes to the database:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

6. **Update `init_db()`**:
   Remove the `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` line from `init_db()` and replace it with a call to Alembic to handle migrations.

### Example of Updated `init_db()`:
```python
def init_db() -> None:
    from alembic import command
    from alembic.config import Config

    alembic_cfg = Config("alembic.ini")
    command.upgrade(alembic_cfg, "head")
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing Alembic for database migrations, you ensure that the existing Student data is preserved while adding the new Course table. This approach adheres to best practices for database management and will prevent potential data loss.

Please proceed with these changes to ensure the application meets the requirements effectively."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

### Additional Steps for Alembic
1. **Install Alembic**:
   ```bash
   pip install alembic
   ```

2. **Initialize Alembic**:
   Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   ```

3. **Configure Alembic**:
   Update the `alembic.ini` file to point to your database URL:
   ```ini
   sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///./students.db
   ```

4. **Create Migration Script**:
   Generate a migration script after modifying your models:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add Course table"
   ```

5. **Apply Migration**:
   Run the migration to apply changes to the database:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

By following these steps and using the provided code, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements effectively while preserving existing Student data.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error message you provided indicates that there is a circular import issue in your code. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

### Summary of the Issue:
1. **Circular Import**: The error message states that there is an `ImportError` due to a circular import. This occurs when two or more modules depend on each other directly or indirectly, leading to a situation where Python cannot resolve the imports.

### Specifics of the Circular Import:
- In `models.py`, you have the following line:
  ```python
  from database import Base
  ```
  This line attempts to import `Base` from `database.py`.

- In `database.py`, you have:
  ```python
  from models import Base  # Import Base from models
  ```
  This line attempts to import `Base` from `models.py`.

### Resolution Steps:
To resolve this circular import issue, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define `Base` in a Separate Module**: Create a new module (e.g., `base.py`) that contains the definition of `Base` using `declarative_base()` from SQLAlchemy. This way, both `models.py` and `database.py` can import `Base` from `base.py` without causing a circular dependency.

   Example of `base.py`:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
   Base = declarative_base()
   ```

2. **Update Imports**: Modify the import statements in both `models.py` and `database.py` to import `Base` from the new `base.py` module.

   - In `models.py`:
     ```python
     from base import Base
     ```

   - In `database.py`:
     ```python
     from base import Base
     ```

### Conclusion:
By separating the `Base` definition into its own module, you can eliminate the circular import issue and allow both `models.py` and `database.py` to function correctly. After making these changes, you should be able to run your application without encountering the circular import error.

 The error message you provided indicates that there is a circular import issue in your code. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

### Summary of the Issue:
1. **Circular Import**: The error message states that there is an `ImportError` due to a circular import. This occurs when two or more modules depend on each other directly or indirectly, leading to a situation where Python cannot resolve the imports.

### Specifics of the Circular Import:
- In `models.py`, you have the following line:
  ```python
  from database import Base
  ```
  This line attempts to import `Base` from `database.py`.

- In `database.py`, you have:
  ```python
  from models import Base  # Import Base from models
  ```
  This line attempts to import `Base` from `models.py`.

### Resolution Steps:
To resolve this circular import issue, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define `Base` in a Separate Module**: Create a new module (e.g., `base.py`) that contains the definition of `Base` using `declarative_base()` from SQLAlchemy. This way, both `models.py` and `database.py` can import `Base` from `base.py` without causing a circular dependency.

   Example of `base.py`:
   ```python

### Conclusion:
By separating the `Base` definition into its own module, you can eliminate the circular import issue and allow both `models.py` and `database.py` to function correctly. After making these changes, you should be able to run your application without encountering the circular import error.

You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

With these changes, the circular import issue has been resolved by defining `Base` in a separate `base.py` module. Both `models.py` and `database.py` now import `Base` from this new module, allowing the application to execute smoothly and robustly.

def init_db() -> None:

```

With these changes, the circular import issue has been resolved by defining `Base` in a separate `base.py` module. Both `models.py` and `database.py` now import `Base` from this new module, allowing the application to execute smoothly and robustly.

alembic==1.10.2
pydantic==1.10.7
```

### Explanation of the Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The main framework used for building the web application.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used for database interactions.
- **alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy, used to manage database schema changes.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization with FastAPI.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers as necessary based on your project's requirements or the latest stable releases.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Course Management System

A simple API for managing students and courses.

## Overview

This application allows users to create and manage students and courses. It provides endpoints to create and retrieve student and course information. The application is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, ensuring a robust and efficient backend.

## Main Functions

- **Create Student**: Add a new student with a name and email.
- **Get Students**: Retrieve a list of all students.
- **Create Course**: Add a new course with a name and level.
- **Get Courses**: Retrieve a list of all courses.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd student_app
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy alembic
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from database import init_db; init_db()"
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To start the FastAPI application, run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### API Endpoints

#### Students

- **Create Student**
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /students/`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```

- **Get Students**
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /students/`
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com"
      }
    ]
    ```

#### Courses

- **Create Course**
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /courses/`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "level": "Beginner"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "level": "Beginner"
    }
    ```

- **Get Courses**
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /courses/`
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Mathematics",
        "level": "Beginner"
      }
    ]
    ```

## Database Migration

The application uses Alembic for database migrations. To ensure that existing student data is preserved when creating the new Course table, the migration scripts should be carefully managed. You can run migrations using:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Conclusion

This Course Management System provides a simple yet effective way to manage students and courses. For further customization or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.

```
