# Student Management Application

A simple application for managing student records, including adding and viewing students with their names and email addresses.

## Main Functions

- **Add Student**: Allows users to input a student's name and email address, which will be stored in the database.
- **View Students**: Displays a list of all students currently stored in the database, showing both their names and email addresses.

## Quick Install

To run the Student Management application, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using `pip`. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

1. **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. **Install SQLAlchemy**:
   ```bash
   pip install sqlalchemy
   ```

3. **Install Pydantic**:

   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   After installing the dependencies, navigate to the directory where your application files are located and run the following command:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   This will start the FastAPI server, and you can access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Open the GUI**:
   In a separate terminal, run the GUI application:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```
   This will open a graphical user interface for the Student Management application.

3. **Adding a Student**:
   - Enter the student's name in the "Student Name" field.
   - Enter the student's email in the "Student Email" field.
   - Click the "Add Student" button to save the student record. A success message will appear if the student is added successfully.

4. **Viewing Students**:
   - Click the "View Students" button to display the list of all students. The list will show each student's name and email address.

## Additional Information

- The application uses SQLite as the database to store student records.
- The database schema has been updated to include an email field for each student, ensuring that all existing data is preserved during migrations.
- You can access the API documentation automatically generated by FastAPI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
