To address the customer's task of creating a Teacher entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. Given the simplicity of the data structure (name and email fields), I believe a straightforward approach would be beneficial. 

A Document format could be useful for presenting the Teacher entity in a structured way, allowing for easy sharing and editing. However, if we want to visualize the relationships or present this data alongside other entities like Student and Course, a Dashboard might be more effective.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you lean towards a Document or a Dashboard, or do you have another modality in mind?

I appreciate your insights on the potential modalities. A Document format would indeed provide a clear and structured presentation of the Teacher entity, making it easy to share and edit. However, considering that we may want to visualize the relationships between the Teacher, Student, and Course entities, a Dashboard could offer a more dynamic and interactive way to present this information.

Additionally, a Dashboard could allow us to incorporate real-time data and provide a comprehensive view of the educational environment, which might be more appealing to the customer.

I am leaning towards the Dashboard option for its interactivity and ability to visualize relationships. What do you think? Would you agree with this direction, or do you still prefer the Document format?

I see the value in your perspective regarding the Dashboard. Its interactivity and ability to visualize relationships between the Teacher, Student, and Course entities would indeed provide a more comprehensive view of the educational environment. This could enhance the user experience and make the data more engaging for stakeholders.

While the Document format offers clarity and ease of sharing, the dynamic nature of a Dashboard aligns better with our goal of presenting interconnected data. Given these considerations, I agree that the Dashboard would be the more suitable choice for this task.

Shall we finalize our decision on the Dashboard as the product modality?

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[2025-28-10 07:42:57 INFO] Code Reviewer: **Code Reviewer<->Programmer on : CodeReviewComment, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a few areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of creating a Teacher entity and ensuring the existing functionality remains intact. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model is not defined or imported in any of the files. This is essential for the application to recognize the `Teacher` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for handling `Teacher` entities in the FastAPI application. We need to implement methods for creating and retrieving teachers.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: While existing methods have comments, the new methods for `Teacher` will also need appropriate documentation.

4. **No potential bugs**: The current code does not have any apparent bugs, but the absence of the `Teacher` entity and its methods could lead to runtime errors when trying to access them.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not currently fulfill the requirement to create a `Teacher` entity.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The GUI does not provide any interface for interacting with the `Teacher` entity.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the `Teacher` entity and its associated methods in the FastAPI application. This needs to be addressed to fulfill the customer's requirements.

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Create the Teacher Model**: Add a new model for `Teacher` in `models.py`.
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = "teachers"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Pydantic Schemas**: Add schemas for `Teacher` in `schemas.py`.
   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: str

   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str
   ```

3. **Add API Endpoints**: Implement the necessary endpoints in `main.py` for creating and retrieving teachers.
   ```python
   @app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse, status_code=201)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])
   def read_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return teachers
   ```

4. **Update Database Migration**: Create a new migration script to add the `teachers` table while preserving existing data.
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')
       )
   ```

5. **Update GUI**: Modify `gui.py` to include functionality for adding and viewing teachers.

By implementing these changes, the application will fulfill the customer's requirements and maintain the existing functionality.

### Instructions on Fix:
1. Add the `Teacher` model to `models.py`.
2. Create the `TeacherCreate` and `TeacherResponse` schemas in `schemas.py`.
3. Implement the API endpoints for teachers in `main.py`.
4. Create a migration script to add the `teachers` table.
5. Update the GUI to allow interaction with the `Teacher` entity.

Following these steps will ensure that the application meets the requirements and is fully operational.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Sure! Below are the modified codes that include the creation of the Teacher entity with the required fields (name and email), as well as the necessary updates to the database schema and migration scripts. Each file is formatted according to your specifications.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Teacher` model is imported in the `env.py`, `main.py`, and `gui.py` files, which is correct. However, ensure that all necessary imports are present in every file where they are used.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods in the `gui.py` file are implemented correctly, including the new methods for adding and viewing teachers.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present in most methods, but some methods could benefit from additional comments explaining their purpose and functionality.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs at a glance. However, ensure that the database migration scripts are executed in the correct order to avoid issues.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project meets the requirements of creating a `Teacher` entity with the specified fields and updating the database schema accordingly.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI allows for interaction with the `Teacher` entity, and the API endpoints are correctly set up to handle requests related to teachers.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the **database migration order**. The migration script `20231002_add_teacher_table.py` must be executed after `20231001_add_course_table.py`. If the migrations are not executed in the correct order, it could lead to issues where the `teachers` table is not created properly, especially if there are dependencies on existing tables.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Ensure Migration Order**: 
   - Double-check that the `down_revision` in `20231002_add_teacher_table.py` correctly references `20231001_add_course_table`. This ensures that the migrations are applied in the correct sequence.

2. **Run Migrations**: 
   - After confirming the migration order, run the migrations using the command:
     ```bash
     alembic upgrade head
     ```
   - This will apply all migrations in the correct order.

3. **Testing**: 
   - After running the migrations, thoroughly test the application to ensure that all functionalities related to the `Teacher` entity work as expected, including adding and viewing teachers.

By following these suggestions, you will ensure that the application operates smoothly and meets all user requirements without any issues.

If you implement these changes and confirm the migration order, the project should be ready for deployment.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The database migration scripts for adding the Teacher table (`20231002_add_teacher_table.py`) should be executed after the initial migration for the Course table (`20231001_add_course_table.py`). However, the `down_revision` in `20231002_add_teacher_table.py` is incorrectly set to `20231001_add_course_table`, which could lead to issues when rolling back migrations.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `down_revision` in `20231002_add_teacher_table.py` to `None`** if it is the first migration or to the correct previous migration ID that it should depend on. Since this is the second migration, it should reference the last migration that was successfully applied.

Here’s how the corrected migration script should look:

```python
'''
Migration script to add Teacher table.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '20231002_add_teacher_table'  # Unique revision ID
down_revision = '20231001_add_course_table'  # Ensure this is the correct previous migration ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None
def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')
    )
def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('teachers')
```

### Instructions:
- Ensure that the `down_revision` in `20231002_add_teacher_table.py` correctly references the last migration that was applied. If `20231001_add_course_table` is indeed the last migration, then it is correct as is. If not, adjust it accordingly.
- After making the changes, run the migration command again to ensure that the database schema updates correctly without any issues.

By addressing this comment, you will ensure that the migration process works smoothly and that the application can be deployed without encountering migration-related errors. 

If there are no further issues after this adjustment, the code will be ready for deployment.

However, the down_revision in 20231002_add_teacher_table.py is incorrectly set to 20231001_add_course_table, which could lead to issues when rolling back migrations.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Update the down_revision in 20231002_add_teacher_table.py to None if it is the first migration or to the correct previous migration ID that it should depend on. Since this is the second migration, it should reference the last migration that was successfully applied.\n\nHere’s how the corrected migration script should look:\n\npython\n'''\nMigration script to add Teacher table.\n'''\nfrom alembic import op\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\n# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.\nrevision = '20231002_add_teacher_table'  # Unique revision ID\ndown_revision = '20231001_add_course_table'  # Ensure this is the correct previous migration ID\nbranch_labels = None\ndepends_on = None\ndef upgrade():\n    op.create_table(\n        'teachers',\n        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')\n    )\ndef downgrade():\n    op.drop_table('teachers')\n\n\n### Instructions:\n- Ensure that the down_revision in 20231002_add_teacher_table.py correctly references the last migration that was applied. If 20231001_add_course_table is indeed the last migration, then it is correct as is. If not, adjust it accordingly.\n- After making the changes, run the migration command again to ensure that the database schema updates correctly without any issues.\n\nBy addressing this comment, you will ensure that the migration process works smoothly and that the application can be deployed without encountering migration-related errors. \n\nIf there are no further issues after this adjustment, the code will be ready for deployment."} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The database migration scripts for adding the Teacher table (`20231002_add_teacher_table.py`) should be executed after the initial migration for the Course table (`20231001_add_course_table.py`). However, the `down_revision` in `20231002_add_teacher_table.py` is incorrectly set to `20231001_add_course_table`, which could lead to issues when rolling back migrations.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `down_revision` in `20231002_add_teacher_table.py` to `None`** if it is the first migration or to the correct previous migration ID that it should depend on. Since this is the second migration, it should reference the last migration that was successfully applied.

Here’s how the corrected migration script should look:

```python
'''
Migration script to add Teacher table.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = '20231002_add_teacher_table'  # Unique revision ID
down_revision = '20231001_add_course_table'  # Ensure this is the correct previous migration ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None
def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')
    )
def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('teachers')
```

### Instructions:
- Ensure that the `down_revision` in `20231002_add_teacher_table.py` correctly references the last migration that was applied. If `20231001_add_course_table` is indeed the last migration, then it is correct as is. If not, adjust it accordingly.
- After making the changes, run the migration command again to ensure that the database schema updates correctly without any issues.

By addressing this comment, you will ensure that the migration process works smoothly and that the application can be deployed without encountering migration-related errors. 

If there are no further issues after this adjustment, the code will be ready for deployment."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in the project, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project to run properly:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
alembic==1.10.3
pydantic==1.10.7
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Note: tkinter is included with Python's standard library, no need to specify
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used for building the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **alembic**: The migration tool for managing database schema changes.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **requests**: Used for making HTTP requests in the GUI.
- **tkinter**: The GUI toolkit, which is included with Python's standard library, so it doesn't need to be specified in the requirements file.

Make sure to adjust the versions as necessary based on your project requirements or compatibility.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
alembic==1.10.3
pydantic==1.10.7
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Note: tkinter is included with Python's standard library, no need to specify
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used for building the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **alembic**: The migration tool for managing database schema changes.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **requests**: Used for making HTTP requests in the GUI.
- **tkinter**: The GUI toolkit, which is included with Python's standard library, so it doesn't need to be specified in the requirements file.
Make sure to adjust the versions as necessary based on your project requirements or compatibility. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
