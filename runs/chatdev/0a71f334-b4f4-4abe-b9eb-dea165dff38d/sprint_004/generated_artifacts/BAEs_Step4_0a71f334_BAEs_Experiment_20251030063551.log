To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be a **Dashboard**, which would allow us to visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time. This could include metrics such as the number of courses each student is enrolled in, course completion rates, and other relevant statistics.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Document** format, where we could provide a detailed report outlining the changes made to the database schema, including the new relationships and how they affect existing data.

Another possibility is to create a **Mind Map** that visually represents the relationship between students and courses, making it easy to understand the connections at a glance.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you have a preference for one of these modalities, or do you see another option that might work better?

I appreciate your insights on the different modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic and interactive way to visualize the relationship between students and courses, allowing users to engage with the data in real-time. This could be particularly beneficial for administrators who need to monitor student enrollment and course participation.

On the other hand, a **Document** would serve as a comprehensive reference, detailing the technical aspects of the database changes and ensuring clarity on how the new relationships are structured. This could be useful for stakeholders who require a more formal presentation of the changes.

The **Mind Map** could be a great tool for brainstorming and conceptualizing the relationships, but it may not provide the depth of information needed for implementation and ongoing management.

Considering the customer's needs for both clarity and functionality, I lean towards the **Dashboard** as it combines visualization with interactivity, making it a practical choice for ongoing use.

What do you think about prioritizing the Dashboard for this task?

I agree with your assessment of the Dashboard as a strong choice for this task. Its dynamic and interactive nature will allow users to engage with the data effectively, making it easier for administrators to monitor and manage student-course relationships. 

The ability to visualize data in real-time will not only enhance understanding but also facilitate quick decision-making based on current enrollment and participation metrics. Additionally, the Dashboard can be designed to include various filters and views, further enhancing its utility for different stakeholders.

Given the importance of both functionality and user engagement in this context, I believe we should proceed with the Dashboard as our product modality for this task. 

Are we in agreement on this choice? If so, we can finalize our decision.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code review reveals several areas that need attention to meet the requirements and regulations set forth. Here is the highest priority comment and corresponding suggestions for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Between Student and Course Entities**

The current implementation does not establish a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. To fulfill the requirement that a `Student` can have courses, we need to implement a many-to-many relationship between these two entities.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` to include a relationship:**
   - Add an association table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.
   - Update the `Student` and `Course` classes to include the relationship.

Here’s how you can modify the `models.py`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update the `schemas.py` to reflect the changes:**
   - Add a field to the `StudentResponse` schema to include the courses associated with a student.

Here’s how you can modify the `schemas.py`:

```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: list[CourseResponse] = []  # Add this line to include courses
```

3. **Update the API endpoints in `api.py`:**
   - Modify the `create_student` and `get_students` functions to handle course associations.

Here’s how you can modify the `api.py`:

```python
@router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, course_ids: list[int] = [], db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    try:
        db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)
        if course_ids:
            db_student.courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id.in_(course_ids)).all()
        db.add(db_student)
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(db_student)
        return db_student
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    try:
        students = db.query(Student).options(joinedload(Student.courses)).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
        return students
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
```

4. **Create a new migration script:**
   - After making these changes, create a new migration script to add the association table to the database.

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add student_courses association table"
alembic upgrade head
```

By implementing these changes, you will establish the required relationship between `Student` and `Course`, allowing students to have courses while preserving existing data.

### Summary:
- Implement a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.
- Update the schemas and API endpoints accordingly.
- Create a new migration to reflect these changes in the database.

Following these suggestions will ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements and adheres to the regulations set by ChatDev.

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    try:
        students = db.query(Student).options(joinedload(Student.courses)).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
        return students
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
```

4. **Create a new migration script:**
   - After making these changes, create a new migration script to add the association table to the database.

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add student_courses association table"
alembic upgrade head
```

By implementing these changes, you will establish the required relationship between `Student` and `Course`, allowing students to have courses while preserving existing data.

### Summary:
- Implement a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.
- Update the schemas and API endpoints accordingly.
- Create a new migration to reflect these changes in the database.

Following these suggestions will ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements and adheres to the regulations set by ChatDev.

Comments on Codes:
"The code review reveals several areas that need attention to meet the requirements and regulations set forth. Here is the highest priority comment and corresponding suggestions for revision:

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Between Student and Course Entities**

The current implementation does not establish a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. To fulfill the requirement that a `Student` can have courses, we need to implement a many-to-many relationship between these two entities.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` to include a relationship:**
   - Add an association table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.
   - Update the `Student` and `Course` classes to include the relationship.

Here’s how you can modify the `models.py`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update the `schemas.py` to reflect the changes:**
   - Add a field to the `StudentResponse` schema to include the courses associated with a student.

Here’s how you can modify the `schemas.py`:

```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: list[CourseResponse] = []  # Add this line to include courses
```

3. **Update the API endpoints in `api.py`:**
   - Modify the `create_student` and `get_students` functions to handle course associations.

Here’s how you can modify the `api.py`:

```python
@router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, course_ids: list[int] = [], db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    try:
        db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)
        if course_ids:
            db_student.courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id.in_(course_ids)).all()
        db.add(db_student)
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(db_student)
        return db_student
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    try:
        students = db.query(Student).options(joinedload(Student.courses)).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
        return students
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
```

4. **Create a new migration script:**
   - After making these changes, create a new migration script to add the association table to the database.

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add student_courses association table"
alembic upgrade head
```

By implementing these changes, you will establish the required relationship between `Student` and `Course`, allowing students to have courses while preserving existing data.

### Summary:
- Implement a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.
- Update the schemas and API endpoints accordingly.
- Create a new migration to reflect these changes in the database.

Following these suggestions will ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements and adheres to the regulations set by ChatDev.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

'comments': 'The code review reveals several areas that need attention to meet the requirements and regulations set forth. Here is the highest priority comment and corresponding suggestions for revision:\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nMissing Relationship Between Student and Course Entities\n\nThe current implementation does not establish a relationship between the Student and Course entities. To fulfill the requirement that a Student can have courses, we need to implement a many-to-many relationship between these two entities.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Update the models.py to include a relationship:\n   - Add an association table to represent the many-to-many relationship between Student and Course.\n   - Update the Student and Course classes to include the relationship.\n\nHere’s how you can modify the models.py:\n\npython\nfrom sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n\n# Association table for the many-to-many relationship\nstudent_courses = Table(\n    \'student_courses\',\n    Base.metadata,\n    Column(\'student_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n    Column(\'course_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n)\n\nclass Student(Base):\n    __tablename__ = "students"\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")\n\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = "courses"\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n\n\n2. Update the schemas.py to reflect the changes:\n   - Add a field to the StudentResponse schema to include the courses associated with a student.\n\nHere’s how you can modify the schemas.py:\n\npython\nclass StudentResponse(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    email: str\n    courses: list[CourseResponse] = []  # Add this line to include courses\n\n\n3. Update the API endpoints in api.py:\n   - Modify the create_student and get_students functions to handle course associations.\n\nHere’s how you can modify the api.py:\n\npython\n@router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)\ndef create_student(student: StudentCreate, course_ids: list[int] = [], db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    try:\n        db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)\n        if course_ids:\n            db_student.courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id.in_(course_ids)).all()\n        db.add(db_student)\n        db.commit()\n        db.refresh(db_student)\n        return db_student\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))\n\n@router.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])\ndef get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    try:\n        students = db.query(Student).options(joinedload(Student.courses)).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()\n        return students\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))\n\n\n4. Create a new migration script:\n   - After making these changes, create a new migration script to add the association table to the database.\n\nbash\nalembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add student_courses association table"\nalembic upgrade head\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will establish the required relationship between Student and Course, allowing students to have courses while preserving existing data.\n\n### Summary:\n- Implement a many-to-many relationship between Student and Course.\n- Update the schemas and API endpoints accordingly.\n- Create a new migration to reflect these changes in the database.\n\nFollowing these suggestions will ensure that the software meets the customer\'s requirements and adheres to the regulations set by ChatDev.\n\n'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements of adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Script Needs Revision**: The migration script (`migration.py`) does not include the necessary logic to preserve existing data when creating the new `courses` table and the `student_courses` association table. If the tables already exist, the migration should not attempt to create them again, as this could lead to data loss or errors.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade` function in `migration.py`**:
   - Before creating the `courses` and `student_courses` tables, check if they already exist. If they do, skip the creation to avoid errors.
   - You can use the `op.get_bind()` method to check for existing tables.

Here is a revised version of the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Check if the 'courses' table already exists
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('courses'):
        # Create the Course table
        op.create_table(
            'courses',
            sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True, index=True),
            sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
            sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        )
    
    # Check if the 'student_courses' table already exists
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('student_courses'):
        # Create the association table for Student and Course
        op.create_table(
            'student_courses',
            sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
            sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
        )
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the `alembic` versioning is correctly managed by updating the `revision` and `down_revision` identifiers appropriately.
- Consider adding error handling in the migration script to manage any unexpected issues during the migration process.

By implementing these changes, the migration will be more robust and will preserve existing data while allowing the new relationship to be established between the Student and Course entities.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

        # Create the association table for Student and Course
        op.create_table(
            'student_courses',
            sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements of adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Script Needs Revision**: The migration script (`migration.py`) does not include the necessary logic to preserve existing data when creating the new `courses` table and the `student_courses` association table. If the tables already exist, the migration should not attempt to create them again, as this could lead to data loss or errors.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade` function in `migration.py`**:
   - Before creating the `courses` and `student_courses` tables, check if they already exist. If they do, skip the creation to avoid errors.
   - You can use the `op.get_bind()` method to check for existing tables.

Here is a revised version of the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Check if the 'courses' table already exists
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('courses'):
        # Create the Course table
        op.create_table(
            'courses',
            sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True, index=True),
            sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
            sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        )
    
    # Check if the 'student_courses' table already exists
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('student_courses'):
        # Create the association table for Student and Course
        op.create_table(
            'student_courses',
            sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
            sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
        )
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the `alembic` versioning is correctly managed by updating the `revision` and `down_revision` identifiers appropriately.
- Consider adding error handling in the migration script to manage any unexpected issues during the migration process.

By implementing these changes, the migration will be more robust and will preserve existing data while allowing the new relationship to be established between the Student and Course entities.

However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nDatabase Migration Script Needs Revision: The migration script (migration.py) does not include the necessary logic to preserve existing data when creating the new courses table and the student_courses association table. If the tables already exist, the migration should not attempt to create them again, as this could lead to data loss or errors.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Modify the upgrade function in migration.py:\n   - Before creating the courses and student_courses tables, check if they already exist. If they do, skip the creation to avoid errors.\n   - You can use the op.get_bind() method to check for existing tables.\n\nHere is a revised version of the upgrade function:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Check if the 'courses' table already exists\n    if not op.get_bind().has_table('courses'):\n        # Create the Course table\n        op.create_table(\n            'courses',\n            sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True, index=True),\n            sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n            sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        )\n    \n    # Check if the 'student_courses' table already exists\n    if not op.get_bind().has_table('student_courses'):\n        # Create the association table for Student and Course\n        op.create_table(\n            'student_courses',\n            sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),\n            sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)\n        )\n\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- Ensure that the alembic versioning is correctly managed by updating the revision and down_revision identifiers appropriately.\n- Consider adding error handling in the migration script to manage any unexpected issues during the migration process.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the migration will be more robust and will preserve existing data while allowing the new relationship to be established between the Student and Course entities.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"} |

The migration script (`migration.py`) does not handle the preservation of existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables when creating the new association table `student_courses`. If the migration is run on an existing database with data, it could lead to issues where the relationships between students and courses are not established correctly, or existing data could be lost if the tables are dropped and recreated.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Modify the `upgrade()` function** to ensure that existing data is preserved. Instead of dropping and recreating tables, you should check for existing records and only create the association table if it does not exist. Additionally, you might want to consider populating the `student_courses` table based on existing relationships if applicable.

2. **Add logic to handle existing data**: If there are already students and courses in the database, you should create a mechanism to populate the `student_courses` table based on existing relationships, if any.

Here’s a revised version of the `upgrade()` function that includes these considerations:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the Course table if it does not exist
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('courses'):
        op.create_table(
            'courses',
            sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True, index=True),
            sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
            sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        )
    
    # Create the association table for Student and Course if it does not exist
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('student_courses'):
        op.create_table(
            'student_courses',
            sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
            sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
        )
        
        # Optional: Logic to populate student_courses based on existing data can be added here
```

This ensures that the migration process does not inadvertently disrupt existing data and relationships. 

Please implement these changes to ensure the integrity of the database during migrations.

    # Create the association table for Student and Course if it does not exist

        op.create_table(
            'student_courses',

            sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
        )

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

- **Create Students**: Add new students to the database along with their enrolled courses.
- **Retrieve Students**: Fetch a list of students with their associated courses.
- **Create Courses**: Add new courses to the database.
- **Retrieve Courses**: Fetch a list of available courses.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-course-management.git
   cd student-course-management
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy alembic
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   The application uses SQLite for the database. Ensure that the `students.db` file is created in the project directory. This will be handled automatically when you run the application for the first time.

## How to Use

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Create a Student

- **Endpoint**: `POST /students/`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "course_ids": [1, 2]  // Optional: List of course IDs to enroll the student in
  }
  ```

#### 2. Retrieve Students

- **Endpoint**: `GET /students/`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `skip`: Number of records to skip (for pagination).
  - `limit`: Maximum number of records to return.

#### 3. Create a Course

- **Endpoint**: `POST /courses/`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Mathematics",
    "level": "Beginner"
  }
  ```

#### 4. Retrieve Courses

- **Endpoint**: `GET /courses/`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `skip`: Number of records to skip (for pagination).
  - `limit`: Maximum number of records to return.

## Database Migration

To apply database migrations, use the following commands:

1. Create a new migration:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add course relationship to Student"
   ```

2. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```
