# ChatDev Course Management System

Welcome to the ChatDev Course Management System! This software allows you to manage students, courses, and teachers efficiently. You can create, retrieve, and manage relationships between these entities seamlessly.

## Main Functions

- **Manage Students**: Create, retrieve, and associate students with courses.
- **Manage Courses**: Create and retrieve courses, and associate them with teachers.
- **Manage Teachers**: Create and retrieve teachers, and associate them with courses.
- **Relationships**: Establish relationships between courses and teachers, as well as students and courses.

## Quick Install

To get started, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi sqlalchemy alembic
```

Or if you prefer using conda:

```bash
conda install fastapi sqlalchemy alembic -c conda-forge
```

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the install command mentioned above.

4. **Database Setup**: The application uses SQLite for the database. Ensure that the `students.db` file is created in the project directory.

5. **Run Migrations**: To set up the database schema, run the migration script:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```
