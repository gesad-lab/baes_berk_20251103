To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how we want to present the information regarding this new relationship. 

One option could be to create a **Dashboard** that visualizes the relationships between students and their courses, allowing for real-time updates and insights into student enrollment and course offerings. This would provide an interactive way for users to engage with the data.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Document** format, which could detail the changes made to the database schema and provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship between students and courses. This would be more static but could serve as a formal record of the implementation.

Another possibility is to use a **Website** to present this information, allowing users to explore the relationships dynamically and interactively, perhaps even incorporating features for users to manage their courses.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the various modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide an interactive and engaging way to visualize the relationships between students and courses, which could be beneficial for users who want real-time insights. 

On the other hand, a **Document** would serve as a formal record and could be useful for stakeholders who need detailed information about the changes made to the database schema. 

The **Website** option also has merit, as it allows for dynamic exploration of the relationships and could potentially include user management features.

Considering the nature of the task and the need for clarity in presenting the new relationships, I lean towards the **Dashboard** for its interactivity and real-time capabilities. However, I see value in the **Document** for formal documentation purposes.

What do you think about prioritizing the **Dashboard** while also considering a supplementary **Document** for detailed records?

I agree that prioritizing the **Dashboard** makes sense given its interactive nature and ability to provide real-time insights into the relationships between students and courses. This aligns well with the customer's needs for a dynamic representation of the data.

Additionally, having a supplementary **Document** would be beneficial for stakeholders who require a formal record of the changes, including the updated database schema and the rationale behind the relationship implementation. This dual approach would ensure we meet both the interactive and documentation needs of the customer.

Shall we finalize our decision to proceed with the **Dashboard** as the primary product modality, while also preparing a **Document** for formal records?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a significant oversight in establishing the relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. The requirement states that a `Student` should be able to have courses, which implies a many-to-many relationship. However, the current implementation does not reflect this relationship.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Many-to-Many Relationship Implementation:**
The `Student` and `Course` entities need a many-to-many relationship, which requires an association table to link students to courses. This is crucial to fulfill the requirement that a student can have multiple courses.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create an Association Table:**
   Add a new table to serve as an association between `Student` and `Course`.

```python
class StudentCourse(Base):
    __tablename__ = "student_courses"
    student_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True)
    course_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
```

2. **Update the `Student` and `Course` Models:**
   Modify the `Student` and `Course` models to include relationships.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="courses")
```

3. **Update the Migration Script:**
   Create a new migration script to add the `student_courses` table.

```python
'''
Migration script to add Student-Course relationship.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

revision = 'unique_revision_id_for_student_course'  # Replace with actual unique revision ID
down_revision = 'unique_revision_id_for_course'  # Replace with the actual revision ID from xxxx_add_course_table.py
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('student_courses')
```

4. **Update the API Routes:**
   Modify the API routes to allow adding courses to a student.

```python
@student_router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def add_course_to_student(student_id: int, course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not db_student:

### Summary:
To fulfill the requirement of adding a course relationship to the `Student` entity, you need to implement a many-to-many relationship using an association table, update the models accordingly, create a migration script for the new table, and adjust the API routes to support course assignments to students.

Please implement these changes to ensure the application meets the user's requirements effectively.

[2025-29-10 17:08:17 INFO] flask app.py did not start for online log
[2025-29-10 17:08:17 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided has a significant oversight in establishing the relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. The requirement states that a `Student` should be able to have courses, which implies a many-to-many relationship. However, the current implementation does not reflect this relationship.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Many-to-Many Relationship Implementation:**
The `Student` and `Course` entities need a many-to-many relationship, which requires an association table to link students to courses. This is crucial to fulfill the requirement that a student can have multiple courses.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create an Association Table:**
   Add a new table to serve as an association between `Student` and `Course`.

```python
class StudentCourse(Base):
    __tablename__ = "student_courses"
    student_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True)
    course_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
```

2. **Update the `Student` and `Course` Models:**
   Modify the `Student` and `Course` models to include relationships.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="courses")
```

3. **Update the Migration Script:**
   Create a new migration script to add the `student_courses` table.

```python
'''
Migration script to add Student-Course relationship.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

revision = 'unique_revision_id_for_student_course'  # Replace with actual unique revision ID
down_revision = 'unique_revision_id_for_course'  # Replace with the actual revision ID from xxxx_add_course_table.py
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('student_courses')
```

4. **Update the API Routes:**
   Modify the API routes to allow adding courses to a student.

```python
@student_router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def add_course_to_student(student_id: int, course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not db_student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
    db_student.courses.append(db_course)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_course
```

### Summary:
To fulfill the requirement of adding a course relationship to the `Student` entity, you need to implement a many-to-many relationship using an association table, update the models accordingly, create a migration script for the new table, and adjust the API routes to support course assignments to students.

Please implement these changes to ensure the application meets the user's requirements effectively.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a significant oversight in establishing the relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. The requirement states that a `Student` should be able to have courses, which implies a many-to-many relationship. However, the current implementation does not reflect this relationship.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Many-to-Many Relationship Implementation:**
The `Student` and `Course` entities need a many-to-many relationship, which requires an association table to link students to courses. This is crucial to fulfill the requirement that a student can have multiple courses.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create an Association Table:**
   Add a new table to serve as an association between `Student` and `Course`.

```python
class StudentCourse(Base):
    __tablename__ = "student_courses"
    student_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True)
    course_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
```

2. **Update the `Student` and `Course` Models:**
   Modify the `Student` and `Course` models to include relationships.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="courses")
```

3. **Update the Migration Script:**
   Create a new migration script to add the `student_courses` table.

```python
'''
Migration script to add Student-Course relationship.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

revision = 'unique_revision_id_for_student_course'  # Replace with actual unique revision ID
down_revision = 'unique_revision_id_for_course'  # Replace with the actual revision ID from xxxx_add_course_table.py
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('student_courses')
```

4. **Update the API Routes:**
   Modify the API routes to allow adding courses to a student.

```python
@student_router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def add_course_to_student(student_id: int, course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not db_student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
    db_student.courses.append(db_course)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_course
```

### Summary:
To fulfill the requirement of adding a course relationship to the `Student` entity, you need to implement a many-to-many relationship using an association table, update the models accordingly, create a migration script for the new table, and adjust the API routes to support course assignments to students.

Please implement these changes to ensure the application meets the user's requirements effectively."

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a solid structure, but there are a few areas that need attention to ensure it meets the requirements and adheres to the regulations set by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `Course` model and the `Student` model are correctly set up to establish a many-to-many relationship through the `student_courses` association table. However, the `xxxx_add_course_table.py` migration script does not include a migration for the `student_courses` table, which is necessary to support the relationship between `Student` and `Course`. This could lead to runtime errors when trying to add courses to students.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Add the `student_courses` table migration script**: Ensure that the migration script `xxxx_add_student_course_relationship.py` is executed after the `courses` table is created. This will ensure that the relationship is properly established in the database.

2. **Ensure Migration Order**: Make sure that the `down_revision` in `xxxx_add_student_course_relationship.py` correctly references the revision ID of the `xxxx_add_course_table.py` migration script. This ensures that migrations are applied in the correct order.

3. **Database Migration Execution**: After adding the migration scripts, run the migrations to ensure that the database schema is updated correctly without losing existing data.

### Example of Migration Order Fix:
In `xxxx_add_student_course_relationship.py`, ensure the `down_revision` is set to the correct revision ID of the `xxxx_add_course_table.py` migration script. For example:
```python
down_revision = 'unique_revision_id_for_course'  # Ensure this matches the correct ID
```

### Final Note:
After making these changes, test the application to ensure that students can be successfully associated with courses and that all existing data is preserved during the migration.

If you implement these suggestions, the code should function as intended without any issues.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes according to the requirements of the new user's task, ensuring that the relationship between the Student and Course entities is properly established and that the database migration preserves existing data.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a course relationship to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Import for `student_courses` Table in Models:**
The `student_courses` table is referenced in the `relationship` definitions of both `Student` and `Course` models, but the actual table creation migration script (`xxxx_add_student_course_relationship.py`) is not linked to the models. This could lead to runtime errors if the table is not created properly.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Ensure the `student_courses` table is created correctly:**
   - Make sure that the migration script `xxxx_add_student_course_relationship.py` is executed after the `courses` table is created.
   - Verify that the `student_courses` table is properly defined in the database schema.

2. **Add import for `student_courses` in models.py:**
   - Ensure that the `student_courses` table is defined in the models file if it is being used in the relationship.

3. **Update the `models.py` file:**
   - Add the `student_courses` table definition if it is not already included.

Here’s how you can define the `student_courses` table in `models.py`:

```python
class StudentCourse(Base):
    __tablename__ = "student_courses"
    student_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True)
    course_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that all migration scripts are executed in the correct order to maintain data integrity.
- Add comments to the `StudentCourse` model to explain its purpose and how it relates to the `Student` and `Course` models.

By addressing these points, you will ensure that the software is operable and meets the requirements set by the customer without losing any features.

### Summary of Actions:
1. Define the `StudentCourse` model in `models.py`.
2. Ensure the migration scripts are executed in the correct order.
3. Add comments for clarity.

Implement these changes, and the code should be ready for deployment.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a course relationship to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Import for `student_courses` Table in Models:**
The `student_courses` table is referenced in the `relationship` definitions of both `Student` and `Course` models, but the actual table creation migration script (`xxxx_add_student_course_relationship.py`) is not linked to the models. This could lead to runtime errors if the table is not created properly.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Ensure the `student_courses` table is created correctly:**
   - Make sure that the migration script `xxxx_add_student_course_relationship.py` is executed after the `courses` table is created.
   - Verify that the `student_courses` table is properly defined in the database schema.

2. **Add import for `student_courses` in models.py:**
   - Ensure that the `student_courses` table is defined in the models file if it is being used in the relationship.

3. **Update the `models.py` file:**
   - Add the `student_courses` table definition if it is not already included.

Here’s how you can define the `student_courses` table in `models.py`:

```python
class StudentCourse(Base):
    __tablename__ = "student_courses"
    student_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True)
    course_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that all migration scripts are executed in the correct order to maintain data integrity.
- Add comments to the `StudentCourse` model to explain its purpose and how it relates to the `Student` and `Course` models.

By addressing these points, you will ensure that the software is operable and meets the requirements set by the customer without losing any features.

### Summary of Actions:
1. Define the `StudentCourse` model in `models.py`.
2. Ensure the migration scripts are executed in the correct order.
3. Add comments for clarity.

Implement these changes, and the code should be ready for deployment."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, the project is using FastAPI for the web framework, SQLAlchemy for database interactions, and Alembic for database migrations. Additionally, Pydantic is used for data validation. Here’s a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
alembic==1.10.3
pydantic==1.10.7
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **alembic**: The migration tool for handling database schema changes.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

A comprehensive application for managing students and their enrolled courses. This system allows users to create students, create courses, and associate students with multiple courses.

## Main Functions

- **Create Students**: Add new students to the system with their name and email.
- **Create Courses**: Add new courses with a name and level.
- **Enroll Students in Courses**: Associate students with courses, allowing for a many-to-many relationship.
- **Retrieve Students and Courses**: Fetch lists of students and courses from the database.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-course-management.git
   cd student-course-management
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi sqlalchemy alembic
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   The application uses SQLite for simplicity. The database will be created automatically when you run the application.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Access the API**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to access the interactive API documentation provided by FastAPI.

3. **Create a Student**:
   Use the `/students/` endpoint to create a new student by sending a POST request with the following JSON body:
   ```json
   {
       "name": "John Doe",
       "email": "john.doe@example.com"
   }
   ```

4. **Create a Course**:
   Use the `/courses/` endpoint to create a new course by sending a POST request with the following JSON body:
   ```json
   {
       "name": "Mathematics",
       "level": "Beginner"
   }
   ```

5. **Enroll a Student in a Course**:
   Use the `/students/{student_id}/courses/` endpoint to enroll a student in a course by sending a POST request with the following JSON body:
   ```json
   {
       "name": "Mathematics",
       "level": "Beginner"
   }
   ```
   Replace `{student_id}` with the actual ID of the student you want to enroll.

6. **Retrieve Students and Courses**:
   Use the `/students/` and `/courses/` endpoints to get lists of students and courses, respectively.

## Database Migration

The application uses Alembic for database migrations. To apply migrations, run the following command:
