To address the customer's request for creating a Teacher entity, we need to consider the most suitable product modality that can effectively present the information related to this entity. 

I believe a **Document** format could be beneficial as it allows for clear presentation of the Teacher entity's details, including the name and email fields, along with any additional context or instructions for implementation. 

What are your thoughts on this approach?

While a Document format is indeed useful for presenting details, I think a **Database Migration** approach would be more effective in this case. It allows us to directly implement the Teacher entity into the existing database schema, ensuring that the new table is created while preserving the existing Student and Course data. This would provide a practical solution that aligns with the customer's technical requirements.

What do you think about focusing on the Database Migration as our product modality?

I understand your perspective on the Database Migration approach, as it directly addresses the technical implementation of the Teacher entity within the existing database. However, considering the customer's request, we may also want to provide documentation or a report that outlines the changes made during the migration process. 

That said, if we focus solely on the product modality, I agree that **Database Migration** is the most relevant choice for this task, as it aligns with the customer's needs for updating the database schema. 

Shall we finalize on this?

- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's task of creating a Teacher entity, the following steps need to be taken:

1. **Create a new Teacher model** in `models.py`.
2. **Create a migration script** for adding the Teacher table.
3. **Update the schemas** to include the Teacher entity.
4. **Update the main FastAPI application** to handle Teacher creation and retrieval.

### Review of the Existing Code

1. **Importing Classes**: The necessary classes for the new Teacher entity need to be imported in the relevant files.
2. **Implementing Methods**: Methods for creating and retrieving Teachers should be implemented in the FastAPI application.
3. **Comments**: Ensure that all methods have appropriate comments explaining their functionality.
4. **Potential Bugs**: Ensure that the new code does not introduce any bugs and that it integrates seamlessly with the existing code.
5. **Conformance to Requirements**: The new code must meet the requirements specified by the customer.
6. **User Interaction**: Ensure that the user can interact with the software without losing any existing features.

### Highest Priority Comment

The highest priority comment is that **the Teacher entity has not been created, and the corresponding migration script and FastAPI endpoints for creating and retrieving Teachers are missing**. This is critical because the task explicitly requires the creation of a Teacher entity with specific fields.

### Suggestions for Revision

1. **Create Teacher Model**:
   Add the following code to `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Migration Script**:
   Create a new migration script (e.g., `xxxx_add_teacher_table.py`):
   ```python
   '''
   Migration script to add Teacher table to the database.
   '''
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   revision = 'xxxx_add_teacher_table'
   down_revision = 'xxxx_add_course_table'  # Ensure this is the last migration
   branch_labels = None
   depends_on = None

   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_table('teachers')
   ```

3. **Update Schemas**:
   Add the following schemas to `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: str

   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

4. **Update FastAPI Application**:
   Add the following endpoints to `main.py`:
   ```python
   @app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])
   def get_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return teachers
   ```

5. **Update GUI**:
   If necessary, update `gui.py` to include functionality for creating and retrieving Teachers.

### Conclusion

By implementing the above changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating a Teacher entity and ensure that existing data is preserved during migration.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's request for creating a Teacher entity with name and email fields, we will need to create a new migration script, update the models, and modify the schemas accordingly. Below are the modifications and additions to the existing codebase, formatted as requested.

### 1. Create a new migration script for the Teacher table

**xxxx_add_teacher_table.py**
```python
'''
Migration script to add Teacher table to the database.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = 'xxxx_add_teacher_table'
down_revision = 'xxxx_add_course_table'  # Ensure this is the last migration
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None
def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('teachers')
```

### 2. Update the models to include the Teacher entity

**models.py**
```python
'''
Defines the SQLAlchemy models for the application.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
Base = declarative_base()
# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)
class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")

class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

### 3. Update the schemas to include the Teacher entity

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True

class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str

    level: str
    class Config:
        orm_mode = True

class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: str

class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str

### Summary
The above modifications include:
- A new migration script to create the Teacher table.
- Updates to the models to include the Teacher entity.
- New Pydantic schemas for creating and responding with Teacher data.
- Updated FastAPI routes to create and retrieve Teacher entities.

This implementation ensures that the existing Student and Course data is preserved while adding the new Teacher entity as requested by the customer.

### Summary
The above modifications include:
- A new migration script to create the Teacher table.
- Updates to the models to include the Teacher entity.
- New Pydantic schemas for creating and responding with Teacher data.
- Updated FastAPI routes to create and retrieve Teacher entities.

This implementation ensures that the existing Student and Course data is preserved while adding the new Teacher entity as requested by the customer.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code and requirements, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure that the application functions correctly according to the user's task.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script `xxxx_add_teacher_table.py` is correctly defined to create the `teachers` table, but it is not included in the migration sequence. The `down_revision` in the `xxxx_add_teacher_table.py` migration script references `xxxx_add_course_table`, which is correct, but you need to ensure that this migration is executed after all previous migrations, including the one that adds the `students` and `courses` tables. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Ensure Migration Sequence**: Make sure that the migration scripts are executed in the correct order. The `xxxx_add_teacher_table.py` should be added to the migration history after `xxxx_add_course_table`. You may need to adjust the `down_revision` in the `xxxx_add_teacher_table.py` to point to the last migration that was successfully applied before it.

2. **Run Migrations**: After making the necessary adjustments, run the migrations to ensure that the `teachers` table is created without affecting the existing `students` and `courses` data.

3. **Testing**: After running the migrations, test the application to ensure that you can create and retrieve teachers without any issues.

### Example of Migration Adjustment:
If `xxxx_add_course_table` is the last migration applied, ensure that `xxxx_add_teacher_table` has the correct `down_revision`:
```python
down_revision = 'xxxx_add_course_table'  # This is correct
```

### Final Note:
Make sure to run the migration commands to apply the changes to the database and verify that the application can interact with the new `Teacher` entity as expected.

If these adjustments are made, the code should function as intended.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes according to the new user's task and comments. Each file is formatted as specified:

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly according to the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `xxxx_add_teacher_table.py` migration script is correctly defined to create the `teachers` table, but it is not included in the migration sequence. The `down_revision` in this migration script should point to the last migration that was applied before adding the `teachers` table. Currently, it points to `xxxx_add_course_table`, which may not be accurate depending on the migration history. This could lead to issues when running migrations.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `down_revision` in `xxxx_add_teacher_table.py`:** Ensure that the `down_revision` points to the correct last migration that was applied before this migration. If `xxxx_add_course_table` is indeed the last migration, then it is correct. If not, you need to find the correct migration revision ID that precedes this one.

2. **Run Migrations:** After updating the `down_revision`, run the migrations again to ensure that the `teachers` table is created without issues.

Here’s how you can update the `down_revision` if needed:
```python
# In xxxx_add_teacher_table.py
down_revision = 'xxxx_add_course_table'  # Ensure this is the correct last migration
```

### Additional Consideration:
- Ensure that the `Teacher` model is correctly imported in the `main.py` file, as it is already defined in the `models.py` file. This is necessary for the FastAPI endpoints to function correctly.

### Conclusion:
Make sure to verify the migration history and adjust the `down_revision` accordingly. After making these changes, you should be able to run the application without issues.

[2025-28-10 16:33:29 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly according to the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `xxxx_add_teacher_table.py` migration script is correctly defined to create the `teachers` table, but it is not included in the migration sequence. The `down_revision` in this migration script should point to the last migration that was applied before adding the `teachers` table. Currently, it points to `xxxx_add_course_table`, which may not be accurate depending on the migration history. This could lead to issues when running migrations.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `down_revision` in `xxxx_add_teacher_table.py`:** Ensure that the `down_revision` points to the correct last migration that was applied before this migration. If `xxxx_add_course_table` is indeed the last migration, then it is correct. If not, you need to find the correct migration revision ID that precedes this one.

2. **Run Migrations:** After updating the `down_revision`, run the migrations again to ensure that the `teachers` table is created without issues.

Here’s how you can update the `down_revision` if needed:
```python

down_revision = 'xxxx_add_course_table'  # Ensure this is the correct last migration
```

### Additional Consideration:
- Ensure that the `Teacher` model is correctly imported in the `main.py` file, as it is already defined in the `models.py` file. This is necessary for the FastAPI endpoints to function correctly.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in the project, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the FastAPI application, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic for database migrations:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
alembic==1.10.2
pydantic==1.10.7
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Note: tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to install separately
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **alembic**: The migration tool for managing database schema changes.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **requests**: For making HTTP requests in the GUI.
- **tkinter**: The GUI toolkit for creating the user interface (included with Python, so no version specified).

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project's requirements or compatibility.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries used in the project, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the FastAPI application, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic for database migrations:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
alembic==1.10.2
pydantic==1.10.7
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Note: tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to install separately
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **alembic**: The migration tool for managing database schema changes.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **requests**: For making HTTP requests in the GUI.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in the project, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the FastAPI application, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic for database migrations:

For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Teacher Management System

A simple application for managing students, courses, and teachers using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.

## Overview

This application allows users to create, retrieve, and manage records for students, courses, and teachers. It provides a user-friendly GUI for interacting with the FastAPI backend, making it easy to manage educational data.

## Main Functions

- **Student Management**: Create and retrieve student records, including their names, emails, and associated courses.
- **Course Management**: Create and retrieve course records, including course names and levels.
- **Teacher Management**: Create and retrieve teacher records, including names and emails.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy alembic pydantic requests
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   The application uses SQLite for the database. The database will be created automatically when the application starts.

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Using the Application

### GUI Interaction

1. **Open the GUI**:
   The GUI will launch automatically when you run the `gui.py` file. You can run it with:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

2. **Managing Students**:
   - **Create Student**: Enter the student's name, email, and course IDs (comma-separated) and click "Create Student".
   - **Get Students**: Click "Get Students" to retrieve and display a list of all students.

3. **Managing Courses**:
   - **Create Course**: Enter the course name and level, then click "Create Course".
   - **Get Courses**: Click "Get Courses" to retrieve and display a list of all courses.

4. **Managing Teachers**:
   - **Create Teacher**: Enter the teacher's name and email, then click "Create Teacher".
   - **Get Teachers**: Click "Get Teachers" to retrieve and display a list of all teachers.

### API Endpoints

You can also interact with the application via the following API endpoints:

- **Students**:
  - `POST /students/`: Create a new student.
  - `GET /students/`: Retrieve a list of students.

- **Courses**:
  - `POST /courses/`: Create a new course.
  - `GET /courses/`: Retrieve a list of courses.

- **Teachers**:
  - `POST /teachers/`: Create a new teacher.
  - `GET /teachers/`: Retrieve a list of teachers.

## Database Migration

The application uses Alembic for database migrations. To apply migrations, ensure you have the latest migration scripts and run:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

This will create the necessary tables in the database, including the `students`, `courses`, and `teachers` tables.

## Conclusion

This Teacher Management System provides a simple yet effective way to manage educational data. With its easy-to-use GUI and RESTful API, users can efficiently handle student, course, and teacher records.

For further assistance or feature requests, please contact the development team.
