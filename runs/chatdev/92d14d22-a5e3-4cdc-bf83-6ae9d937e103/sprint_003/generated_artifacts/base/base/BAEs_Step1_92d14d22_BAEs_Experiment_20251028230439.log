To address the customer's task of creating a simple web application for a Student entity, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a "Website." This modality allows us to present the functionality of the application effectively while providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Student entity.

What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that a "Website" is a suitable product modality for this task. It will allow users to easily interact with the Student entity and access the API functionalities through a web interface. Additionally, it aligns well with the requirements of using FastAPI for building web applications. 

Let's finalize this decision. What do you think?

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " <Python> *"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  <Python> *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure the application into multiple files. The application will follow best practices for structuring a Python web application and will include a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and the SQLite database.
   - `create_app()`: Function to create and configure the FastAPI application.
   - `run()`: Function to run the FastAPI application.

2. **models.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
   - `Student`: Class representing the Student entity with a name field.

3. **database.py**: Handles database connection and session management.
   - `get_db()`: Function to get a database session.

4. **schemas.py**: Contains Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.
   - `StudentCreate`: Schema for creating a new student.
   - `StudentResponse`: Schema for returning student data.

5. **routes.py**: Contains the API routes for handling student-related requests.
   - `create_student()`: Endpoint to create a new student.
   - `get_students()`: Endpoint to retrieve all students.

6. **gui.py**: Implements the GUI using Tkinter to interact with the FastAPI backend.
   - `StudentApp`: Class for the main application window.
   - `add_student()`: Method to add a student through the GUI.
   - `fetch_students()`: Method to fetch and display students.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code structure and implementation are generally well-organized and adhere to the requirements. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the application operates smoothly and meets all the regulations outlined. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Schema Creation on Startup:**
The current implementation does not automatically create the database schema on startup, which is a requirement specified by the customer. This can lead to runtime errors if the database does not exist when the application is run.

### Suggested Revision:
To ensure the database schema is created automatically on startup, you should add the following code to the `main.py` file:

```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from models import Base
from database import engine
from routes import student_router

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# Include the student routes
app.include_router(student_router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Instructions:
1. **Add the `startup_event` function** to `main.py` to create the database schema when the application starts.
2. **Ensure the FastAPI application is started using Uvicorn** to serve the API.

By implementing this change, the application will automatically create the necessary database tables when it starts, ensuring that the user can interact with the software without encountering issues related to missing database schemas.

If you make this change, the application should meet all the requirements specified by the customer.

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code structure and implementation are mostly aligned with the requirements, but there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the application operates correctly and adheres to best practices. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Schema Creation on Startup:**
The current implementation does not include the automatic creation of the database schema when the application starts. This is a critical requirement that needs to be addressed to ensure that the database is set up correctly before any API calls are made.

### Suggested Revision:
To implement the automatic creation of the database schema on startup, you should add the following code to the `main.py` file. This code will create the tables defined in your models when the FastAPI application starts.

```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from database import engine
from models import Base
from routes import student_router

# Create the FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Create the database tables
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# Include the student routes
app.include_router(student_router)

# Run the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Additional Recommendations:
1. **Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling for database operations in the `create_student` and `get_students` functions to manage exceptions gracefully.
2. **Environment Configuration:** It’s a good practice to use environment variables for sensitive configurations like database URLs.
3. **Documentation:** Ensure that the FastAPI application has proper documentation for the API endpoints, which can be automatically generated by FastAPI.

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and meet the requirements specified by the customer.

### Summary:
- Add schema creation in `main.py` on startup.
- Consider additional error handling and configuration best practices.

If you implement the suggested changes, the application will be fully operational and compliant with the requirements.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is well-structured and adheres to the requirements specified by the customer. However, there are a few areas that need improvement to ensure the application functions correctly and meets best practices.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Schema Creation on Startup:**
The current implementation does not automatically create the database schema on startup, which is a requirement specified by the customer. You need to ensure that the database tables are created when the FastAPI application starts.

### Suggested Revision:
To implement the automatic creation of the database schema, you can modify the `main.py` file to include the necessary code for creating the tables. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Import the necessary functions from SQLAlchemy to create the tables.**
2. **Add the table creation logic in the main application startup event.**

Here’s how you can modify `main.py`:

```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from models import Base  # Import Base to create tables
from database import engine
from routes import student_router

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database tables on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# Include the student routes
app.include_router(student_router)
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that you have the FastAPI server running (`uvicorn main:app --reload`) to test the application.
- The GUI code in `gui.py` is separate from the FastAPI application and should be run independently to interact with the API.

By implementing the above changes, the application will create the necessary database schema automatically when it starts, fulfilling the customer's requirements.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is well-structured and adheres to the requirements specified by the customer. However, there are a few areas that need improvement to ensure the application functions correctly and meets best practices.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Schema Creation on Startup:**
The current implementation does not automatically create the database schema on startup, which is a requirement specified by the customer. You need to ensure that the database tables are created when the FastAPI application starts.

### Suggested Revision:
To implement the automatic creation of the database schema, you can modify the `main.py` file to include the necessary code for creating the tables. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Import the necessary functions from SQLAlchemy to create the tables.**
2. **Add the table creation logic in the main application startup event.**

Here’s how you can modify `main.py`:

```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from models import Base  # Import Base to create tables
from database import engine
from routes import student_router

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database tables on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# Include the student routes
app.include_router(student_router)
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that you have the FastAPI server running (`uvicorn main:app --reload`) to test the application.
- The GUI code in `gui.py` is separate from the FastAPI application and should be run independently to interact with the API.

By implementing the above changes, the application will create the necessary database schema automatically when it starts, fulfilling the customer's requirements.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found, which typically means that the Python installation does not include the Tkinter library. This can happen if Python was installed without the Tkinter package or if the environment is not set up correctly.

To resolve this issue, we can provide instructions for installing Tkinter, but since the task requires modifying the code based on the error summary, we will not modify the code itself, as it is functioning correctly apart from the missing library.

Here’s the output based on the error summary:

**Error Resolution Instructions:**
1. Ensure that Tkinter is installed. If you are using a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu), you can install it using:
   ```bash

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found, which typically means that the Tkinter library is not installed or not available in the current Python environment. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that Tkinter is properly installed. However, since the task does not require modifications to the existing code but rather focuses on ensuring the environment is set up correctly, I will provide instructions for installing Tkinter.

Here’s how to install Tkinter based on the operating system:

### For Windows:
Tkinter is included with the standard Python installation. If you have installed Python from the official website, Tkinter should be available. If not, you may need to reinstall Python and ensure that the "tcl/tk and IDLE" option is selected during installation.

### For macOS:
Tkinter is also included with the standard Python installation. If you installed Python using Homebrew, you can install Tkinter with the following command:
```bash
brew install python-tk
```

### For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
You can install Tkinter using the package manager:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

### For Linux (Fedora):
You can install Tkinter using the package manager:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
```

After ensuring Tkinter is installed, you can run the application again.

Since there are no modifications needed in the code itself based on the error summary, I will return the completion message.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI web application, here is the `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.7
requests==2.28.1
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The main framework used for building the web application.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions with SQLite.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization of request and response models.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to interact with the FastAPI backend.

Make sure to install these dependencies in your Python environment using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

This will ensure that all necessary packages are installed for your application to run smoothly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI web application, here is the `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.7
requests==2.28.1
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The main framework used for building the web application.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions with SQLite.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization of request and response models.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to interact with the FastAPI backend.
Make sure to install these dependencies in your Python environment using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
This will ensure that all necessary packages are installed for your application to run smoothly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chatdev_student_app
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   pydantic

2. **Launch the GUI**:
   In another terminal, run the following command to start the Tkinter GUI:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Adding a Student**:
   - Open the GUI application.
   - Enter the student's name in the input field.
   - Click the "Add Student" button. A success message will appear if the student is added successfully.
