To address the customer's task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we should consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be a Document format, where we can provide detailed specifications and explanations about the changes made to the database schema and the relationship between Course and Teacher entities. This would allow us to include diagrams and textual descriptions.

Alternatively, a Dashboard could be beneficial as it can visualize the relationships in real-time, showing how courses are linked to teachers and potentially allowing for interactive elements.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your suggestions! A Document format would indeed allow us to provide comprehensive details and explanations, which is valuable for understanding the changes made to the database schema. However, I believe a Dashboard could offer a more dynamic and visual representation of the relationship between Courses and Teachers, making it easier for users to grasp the connections at a glance.

Additionally, a Dashboard could facilitate real-time updates and interactions, which might be beneficial for users managing courses and teachers. 

I would lean towards the Dashboard option for its interactivity and visual appeal. What do you think?

I see your point about the Dashboard's interactivity and visual appeal, which can indeed enhance user experience and understanding of the relationships between Courses and Teachers. The ability to visualize data in real-time can provide immediate insights and facilitate better decision-making for users.

However, I still believe that a Document format could serve as a solid foundation for detailed documentation, which is essential for understanding the technical aspects of the changes. 

That said, if we prioritize user engagement and real-time interaction, I agree that the Dashboard might be the more effective choice. 

Shall we finalize on the Dashboard as our product modality?

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a significant oversight regarding the addition of the teacher relationship to the Course entity. Specifically, the Course model does not currently have a relationship defined to link it with the Teacher model. This is a critical requirement of the task, and without it, the software will not function as intended.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Definition:** The `Course` class in `models.py` does not have a foreign key or relationship to the `Teacher` class, which is essential to fulfill the requirement that a course should be able to have a teacher.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model** in `models.py` to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model. This can be done by adding a `teacher_id` column and establishing a relationship.

Here’s how you can modify the `Course` class:

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True)  # Add this line
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model** to include a relationship back to the `Course` model:

```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line
```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas** in `schemas.py` to include the `teacher_id`:

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int = None  # Add this line to allow specifying a teacher

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to return the teacher ID
```

4. **Ensure that the database migration script** (`student.py`) is updated to reflect these changes, ensuring that the new `teacher_id` column is added to the `courses` table.

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the software will correctly establish a relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities, fulfilling the customer's requirements. 

Please proceed with these modifications to ensure the application meets the specified task requirements.

    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line
```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas** in `schemas.py` to include the `teacher_id`:

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int = None  # Add this line to allow specifying a teacher

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):

    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to return the teacher ID

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a significant oversight regarding the addition of the teacher relationship to the Course entity. Specifically, the Course model does not currently have a relationship defined to link it with the Teacher model. This is a critical requirement of the task, and without it, the software will not function as intended.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Definition:** The `Course` class in `models.py` does not have a foreign key or relationship to the `Teacher` class, which is essential to fulfill the requirement that a course should be able to have a teacher.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model** in `models.py` to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model. This can be done by adding a `teacher_id` column and establishing a relationship.

Here’s how you can modify the `Course` class:

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True)  # Add this line
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model** to include a relationship back to the `Course` model:

```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line
```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas** in `schemas.py` to include the `teacher_id`:

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int = None  # Add this line to allow specifying a teacher

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to return the teacher ID
```

4. **Ensure that the database migration script** (`student.py`) is updated to reflect these changes, ensuring that the new `teacher_id` column is added to the `courses` table.

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the software will correctly establish a relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities, fulfilling the customer's requirements. 

Please proceed with these modifications to ensure the application meets the specified task requirements."

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary changes to establish the relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities, as well as updates to the schemas and migration script. Each file is formatted according to your specifications.

Specifically, the Course model does not currently have a relationship defined to link it with the Teacher model. This is a critical requirement of the task, and without it, the software will not function as intended.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nMissing Relationship Definition: The Course class in models.py does not have a foreign key or relationship to the Teacher class, which is essential to fulfill the requirement that a course should be able to have a teacher.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Update the Course model in models.py to include a foreign key reference to the Teacher model. This can be done by adding a teacher_id column and establishing a relationship.\n\nHere’s how you can modify the Course class:\n\npython\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\'teachers.id\'), nullable=True)  # Add this line\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n    teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line to establish the relationship\n\n\n2. Update the Teacher model to include a relationship back to the Course model:\n\npython\nclass Teacher(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'teachers\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line\n\n\n3. Update the CourseCreate and CourseResponse schemas in schemas.py to include the teacher_id:\n\npython\nclass CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n    level: str\n    teacher_id: int = None  # Add this line to allow specifying a teacher\n\nclass CourseResponse(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    level: str\n    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to return the teacher ID\n\n\n4. Ensure that the database migration script (student.py) is updated to reflect these changes, ensuring that the new teacher_id column is added to the courses table.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy implementing these changes, the software will correctly establish a relationship between the Course and Teacher entities, fulfilling the customer\'s requirements. \n\nPlease proceed with these modifications to ensure the application meets the specified task requirements.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic**: The migration script (`student.py`) does not include a mechanism to handle existing data during the migration process. While the code defines the new `Teacher` relationship, it does not ensure that the existing `Course` records are updated to reflect this new relationship. This could lead to data integrity issues if the migration is run on a production database.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement a Migration Script**: Create a migration script that will:
   - Add the `teacher_id` column to the existing `courses` table.
   - Populate the `teacher_id` for existing courses if applicable (e.g., set to `NULL` or a default teacher).
   - Ensure that the migration preserves existing data for `Student`, `Course`, and `Teacher`.

2. **Use Alembic for Migrations**: Consider using Alembic, a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy, to manage schema changes more effectively. This will help in tracking changes and applying them without data loss.

3. **Update the `main.py`**: Ensure that the migration script is executed before the application starts, or provide a command to run migrations separately.

### Example Migration Script:
Here’s an example of how you might implement a migration script using raw SQL to add the `teacher_id` column:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

def migrate():
    with SessionLocal() as session:
        # Add the teacher_id column to the courses table
        session.execute('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER')
        session.commit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    migrate()
```

### Conclusion:
Implementing the above suggestions will ensure that the database migration preserves existing data and maintains the integrity of the relationships between `Course` and `Teacher`. This is crucial for the application to function correctly without losing any features or data.

Please proceed with the suggested changes to ensure compliance with the regulations and the requirements of the task.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic**: The migration script (`student.py`) does not include a mechanism to handle existing data during the migration process. While the code defines the new `Teacher` relationship, it does not ensure that the existing `Course` records are updated to reflect this new relationship. This could lead to data integrity issues if the migration is run on a production database.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement a Migration Script**: Create a migration script that will:
   - Add the `teacher_id` column to the existing `courses` table.
   - Populate the `teacher_id` for existing courses if applicable (e.g., set to `NULL` or a default teacher).
   - Ensure that the migration preserves existing data for `Student`, `Course`, and `Teacher`.

2. **Use Alembic for Migrations**: Consider using Alembic, a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy, to manage schema changes more effectively. This will help in tracking changes and applying them without data loss.

3. **Update the `main.py`**: Ensure that the migration script is executed before the application starts, or provide a command to run migrations separately.

### Example Migration Script:
Here’s an example of how you might implement a migration script using raw SQL to add the `teacher_id` column:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

def migrate():
    with SessionLocal() as session:
        # Add the teacher_id column to the courses table
        session.execute('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER')
        session.commit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    migrate()
```

### Conclusion:
Implementing the above suggestions will ensure that the database migration preserves existing data and maintains the integrity of the relationships between `Course` and `Teacher`. This is crucial for the application to function correctly without losing any features or data.

Please proceed with the suggested changes to ensure compliance with the regulations and the requirements of the task."

However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev. \n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nDatabase Migration Logic: The migration script (student.py) does not include a mechanism to handle existing data during the migration process. While the code defines the new Teacher relationship, it does not ensure that the existing Course records are updated to reflect this new relationship. This could lead to data integrity issues if the migration is run on a production database.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Implement a Migration Script: Create a migration script that will:\n   - Add the teacher_id column to the existing courses table.\n   - Populate the teacher_id for existing courses if applicable (e.g., set to NULL or a default teacher).\n   - Ensure that the migration preserves existing data for Student, Course, and Teacher.\n\n2. Use Alembic for Migrations: Consider using Alembic, a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy, to manage schema changes more effectively. This will help in tracking changes and applying them without data loss.\n\n3. Update the main.py: Ensure that the migration script is executed before the application starts, or provide a command to run migrations separately.\n\n### Example Migration Script:\nHere’s an example of how you might implement a migration script using raw SQL to add the teacher_id column:\n\npython\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\nDATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"\nengine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)\nSessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)\n\ndef migrate():\n    with SessionLocal() as session:\n        # Add the teacher_id column to the courses table\n        session.execute(\'ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER\')\n        session.commit()\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    migrate()\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nImplementing the above suggestions will ensure that the database migration preserves existing data and maintains the integrity of the relationships between Course and Teacher. This is crucial for the application to function correctly without losing any features or data.\n\nPlease proceed with the suggested changes to ensure compliance with the regulations and the requirements of the task.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `teacher_id` field in the `Course` entity is defined as nullable (`nullable=True`), which allows for the creation of courses without an associated teacher. This contradicts the requirement that "Course should be able to have a teacher." If a course is created without a teacher, it may lead to inconsistencies in the application logic and user experience.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Make the `teacher_id` field non-nullable** in the `Course` model to enforce that every course must have an associated teacher. This can be done by changing `nullable=True` to `nullable=False`.
2. **Update the `CourseCreate` schema** to ensure that `teacher_id` is a required field when creating a course.

Here are the specific changes to be made:

#### In `models.py`:
```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=False)  # Change to nullable=False
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")
```

#### In `schemas.py`:
```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Ensure this is required
```

### Additional Considerations:
- Ensure that the database migration script correctly reflects this change and preserves existing data. If there are existing courses without a teacher, you will need to handle this scenario during the migration process.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that every course has a teacher, aligning with the user's requirements and improving the overall integrity of the application.

If you need further assistance with the migration script or any other part of the code, feel free to ask!

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes based on the requirements to add a teacher relationship to the Course entity, ensuring that the database schema is updated accordingly and existing data is preserved.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

# ChatDev Course Management System

Welcome to the ChatDev Course Management System! This software allows you to manage students, courses, and teachers effectively. You can create, retrieve, and manage relationships between these entities seamlessly.

## Main Functions

1. **Student Management**: Create and manage student records, including their enrollment in courses.
2. **Course Management**: Create and manage courses, including assigning teachers to courses.
3. **Teacher Management**: Create and manage teacher records, allowing them to be associated with courses.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   pydantic
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Server**:
   Run the following command to start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Access the API**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to access the interactive API documentation provided by FastAPI. Here, you can test the endpoints for managing students, courses, and teachers.

### API Endpoints

#### Student Endpoints

- **Create Student**: 
  - **POST** `/students/`
  - Request Body: `{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "course_ids": [1, 2] }`
  
- **Get Students**: 
  - **GET** `/students/`

#### Course Endpoints

- **Create Course**: 
  - **POST** `/courses/`
  - Request Body: `{ "name": "Mathematics", "level": "Beginner", "teacher_id": 1 }`

  - **POST** `/teachers/`
  - Request Body: `{ "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com" }`
  
- **Get Teachers**: 
  - **GET** `/teachers/`

### Database Migration

The application is designed to preserve existing data during database migrations. When you add a teacher relationship to the Course entity, the migration script will ensure that existing Student, Course, and Teacher data remains intact.

### Conclusion

This Course Management System is a powerful tool for educational institutions to manage their courses, students, and teachers efficiently. For further assistance, please refer to the API documentation or reach out to our support team.
