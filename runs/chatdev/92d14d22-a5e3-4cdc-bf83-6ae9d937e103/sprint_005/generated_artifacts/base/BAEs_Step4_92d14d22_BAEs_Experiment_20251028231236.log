To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be a **Dashboard**, which would allow us to visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time. This could provide insights into student enrollments and course offerings.

Another option might be a **Document**, where we could provide a detailed report on the changes made to the database schema and how the relationships are structured, along with any relevant data.

We could also consider an **Application** that allows users to interact with the Student and Course entities, perhaps enabling them to enroll students in courses through a user-friendly interface.

What are your thoughts on these modalities?

I appreciate your insights on the potential modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic view of the relationships and could be beneficial for real-time monitoring of student enrollments and course data. It would allow stakeholders to quickly assess the situation and make informed decisions.

On the other hand, a **Document** would serve as a comprehensive guide, detailing the technical aspects of the changes made to the database schema and the rationale behind the relationships. This could be useful for stakeholders who need a deeper understanding of the implementation.

The **Application** option is also compelling, as it would provide an interactive experience for users, allowing them to engage directly with the Student and Course entities. This could enhance usability and facilitate better management of student enrollments.

Considering the customer's needs, I believe a **Dashboard** could be the most effective way to visualize and manage the relationships, while also providing insights. However, I am open to further discussion if you feel another modality might serve the purpose better.

What do you think?

I agree that a **Dashboard** would be an excellent choice for this task. It aligns well with the customer's need for a visual representation of the relationship between Students and Courses, allowing for real-time monitoring and insights. This modality can effectively showcase data trends, student enrollments, and course offerings, making it easier for stakeholders to make informed decisions.

While the **Document** and **Application** options have their merits, the interactive and visual nature of a Dashboard seems to best meet the customer's requirements for managing and understanding the new relationship.

If we are in agreement on the Dashboard being the preferred modality, we can finalize our decision. What do you think?

The code provided has a good structure, but there are some important aspects that need to be addressed to fulfill the requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Definition Between Student and Course:**
The `Student` model does not currently have a relationship defined to associate it with the `Course` model. To allow a student to have multiple courses, we need to establish a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` file** to include a relationship between `Student` and `Course`. This can be done using an association table to handle the many-to-many relationship.

Here’s how you can modify the `models.py`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update the `schemas.py` file** to reflect the changes in the `StudentResponse` schema to include the courses associated with the student:

```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: list[CourseResponse] = []  # Add this line to include courses
```

3. **Update the `create_student` function in `routes.py`** to handle course assignments when creating a student, if necessary.

### Summary of Changes:
- Added an association table to establish a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.
- Updated the `Student` and `Course` models to include the relationship.
- Updated the `StudentResponse` schema to include courses.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirement of allowing students to have courses and will maintain the integrity of the existing data during the migration.

Please proceed with these changes to ensure the application meets the customer's requirements effectively.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a good structure, but there are some important aspects that need to be addressed to fulfill the requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Definition Between Student and Course:**
The `Student` model does not currently have a relationship defined to associate it with the `Course` model. To allow a student to have multiple courses, we need to establish a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` file** to include a relationship between `Student` and `Course`. This can be done using an association table to handle the many-to-many relationship.

Here’s how you can modify the `models.py`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update the `schemas.py` file** to reflect the changes in the `StudentResponse` schema to include the courses associated with the student:

```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: list[CourseResponse] = []  # Add this line to include courses
```

3. **Update the `create_student` function in `routes.py`** to handle course assignments when creating a student, if necessary.

### Summary of Changes:
- Added an association table to establish a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.
- Updated the `Student` and `Course` models to include the relationship.
- Updated the `StudentResponse` schema to include courses.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirement of allowing students to have courses and will maintain the integrity of the existing data during the migration.

Please proceed with these changes to ensure the application meets the customer's requirements effectively."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

not currently have a relationship defined to associate it with the Course model. To allow a student to have multiple courses, we need to establish a many-to-many relationship between Student and Course.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Update the models.py file to include a relationship between Student and Course. This can be done using an association table to handle the many-to-many relationship.\n\nHere’s how you can modify the models.py:\n\npython\nfrom sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n\n# Association table for the many-to-many relationship\nstudent_courses = Table(\n    \'student_courses\',\n    Base.metadata,\n    Column(\'student_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n    Column(\'course_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n)\n\nclass Student(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'students\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")\n\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n\n\n2. Update the schemas.py file to reflect the changes in the StudentResponse schema to include the courses associated with the student:\n\npython\nclass StudentResponse(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    email: str\n    courses: list[CourseResponse] = []  # Add this line to include courses\n\n\n3. Update the create_student function in routes.py to handle course assignments when creating a student, if necessary.\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n- Added an association table to establish a many-to-many relationship between Student and Course.\n- Updated the Student and Course models to include the relationship.\n- Updated the StudentResponse schema to include courses.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirement of allowing students to have courses and will maintain the integrity of the existing data during the migration.\n\nPlease proceed with these changes to ensure the application meets the customer\'s requirements effectively.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are some areas that need attention to ensure it meets the requirements and adheres to the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` class is not imported in `routes.py`. This will cause an error when trying to create a course.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented, but the `create_student` and `create_course` methods do not handle the relationship between students and courses.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present, but additional comments explaining the relationship handling in the `create_student` method would be beneficial.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - There is a potential bug in the `create_student` method where courses are not being added to the student upon creation. This needs to be addressed.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is mostly aligned with the requirements, but the relationship handling is incomplete.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The current implementation does not allow for adding courses to a student, which is a key requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the `create_student` method does not allow for the addition of courses to a student, which is essential for fulfilling the requirement of establishing a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `StudentCreate` schema** to include a list of course IDs that the student should be enrolled in:
   ```python
   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: EmailStr
       course_ids: list[int] = []  # Add this line to include course IDs
   ```

2. **Modify the `create_student` method** in `routes.py` to handle course enrollment:
   ```python
   @student_router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       
       # Enroll student in courses
       if student.course_ids:
           courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id.in_(student.course_ids)).all()
           db_student.courses.extend(courses)  # Add courses to the student
           db.commit()  # Commit the changes
       
       return db_student
   ```

3. **Update the `StudentResponse` schema** to ensure it returns the enrolled courses:
   ```python
   class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str
       courses: list[CourseResponse] = []  # Ensure this returns course details
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will correctly establish the relationship between `Student` and `Course`, allowing students to be created with associated courses, thus fulfilling the customer's requirements.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the software operates as intended and meets all requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are some areas that need attention to ensure it meets the requirements and adheres to the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` class is not imported in `routes.py`. This will cause an error when trying to create a course.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented, but the `create_student` and `create_course` methods do not handle the relationship between students and courses.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present, but additional comments explaining the relationship handling in the `create_student` method would be beneficial.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - There is a potential bug in the `create_student` method where courses are not being added to the student upon creation. This needs to be addressed.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is mostly aligned with the requirements, but the relationship handling is incomplete.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The current implementation does not allow for adding courses to a student, which is a key requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the `create_student` method does not allow for the addition of courses to a student, which is essential for fulfilling the requirement of establishing a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `StudentCreate` schema** to include a list of course IDs that the student should be enrolled in:
   ```python
   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: EmailStr
       course_ids: list[int] = []  # Add this line to include course IDs
   ```

2. **Modify the `create_student` method** in `routes.py` to handle course enrollment:
   ```python
   @student_router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       
       # Enroll student in courses
       if student.course_ids:
           courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id.in_(student.course_ids)).all()
           db_student.courses.extend(courses)  # Add courses to the student
           db.commit()  # Commit the changes
       
       return db_student
   ```

3. **Update the `StudentResponse` schema** to ensure it returns the enrolled courses:
   ```python
   class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str
       courses: list[CourseResponse] = []  # Ensure this returns course details
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will correctly establish the relationship between `Student` and `Course`, allowing students to be created with associated courses, thus fulfilling the customer's requirements.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the software operates as intended and meets all requirements."

Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - The Course class is not imported in routes.py. This will cause an error when trying to create a course.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - All methods are implemented, but the create_student and create_course methods do not handle the relationship between students and courses.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - Comments are present, but additional comments explaining the relationship handling in the create_student method would be beneficial.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - There is a potential bug in the create_student method where courses are not being added to the student upon creation. This needs to be addressed.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The project structure is mostly aligned with the requirements, but the relationship handling is incomplete.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - The current implementation does not allow for adding courses to a student, which is a key requirement.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is that the create_student method does not allow for the addition of courses to a student, which is essential for fulfilling the requirement of establishing a relationship between the Student and Course entities.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Update the StudentCreate schema to include a list of course IDs that the student should be enrolled in:\n   python\n   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       email: EmailStr\n       course_ids: list[int] = []  # Add this line to include course IDs\n\n\n2. Modify the create_student method in routes.py to handle course enrollment:\n   python\n   @student_router.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)\n   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_student = Student(name=student.name, email=student.email)\n       db.add(db_student)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_student)\n       \n       # Enroll student in courses\n       if student.course_ids:\n           courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id.in_(student.course_ids)).all()\n           db_student.courses.extend(courses)  # Add courses to the student\n           db.commit()  # Commit the changes\n       \n       return db_student\n\n\n3. Update the StudentResponse schema to ensure it returns the enrolled courses:\n   python\n   class StudentResponse(BaseModel):\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       email: str\n       courses: list[CourseResponse] = []  # Ensure this returns course details\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will correctly establish the relationship between Student and Course, allowing students to be created with associated courses, thus fulfilling the customer\'s requirements.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease implement the suggested changes to ensure the software operates as intended and meets all requirements.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements of adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure full compliance with the regulations and to enhance the functionality of the application.

**Comment with the Highest Priority:**
The `student_courses` association table is defined in both `models.py` and `student.py`, which can lead to redundancy and potential confusion. It should be defined in one place only to maintain clarity and avoid duplication.

**Suggestions on Revision:**
1. **Consolidate the Association Table:**
   - Move the `student_courses` table definition to `models.py` and remove it from `student.py`. This will ensure that the association table is defined in a single location, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

2. **Update the Migration Script:**
   - Since the `student_courses` table is now only in `models.py`, ensure that the migration script in `student.py` is updated to reflect this change. You can remove the association table definition from `student.py` and just call `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` to create all tables, including the association table.

3. **Ensure Data Migration:**
   - If you are running this migration on an existing database, ensure that the migration script handles existing data properly. You may need to write a custom migration script if you are using a more complex database system or if you want to preserve existing relationships.

4. **Add Comments for Clarity:**
   - Ensure that all methods and classes have appropriate comments explaining their purpose and functionality. This will help future developers understand the code better.

5. **Testing:**
   - After making these changes, run tests to ensure that the application behaves as expected, especially with regards to creating students and enrolling them in courses.

By implementing these suggestions, you will enhance the clarity and maintainability of the code while ensuring that it meets the requirements set forth by the customer.

**Revised Code Example:**

In `models.py`, keep the `student_courses` table definition and remove it from `student.py`:

```python
# models.py
# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)
```

In `student.py`, simply create the tables:

```python
# student.py
'''
Migration script to add Course table to the database.
'''
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from models import Base  # Import Base from models

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

# Create all tables, preserving existing Student data
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

After making these changes, the code should be cleaner and more maintainable.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Student Course Management System

A FastAPI application for managing students and their enrolled courses.

## Main Functions

This application allows users to perform the following functions:

- **Create Students**: Add new students to the database, including their name, email, and enrolled courses.
- **Retrieve Students**: Fetch a list of students with their details and enrolled courses.
- **Create Courses**: Add new courses to the database, specifying the course name and level.
- **Retrieve Courses**: Fetch a list of available courses.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-course-management.git
   cd student-course-management
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## How to Use the Application

### API Endpoints

The application exposes several API endpoints for interacting with students and courses.

#### Create a Student

- **Endpoint**: `POST /students/`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "course_ids": [1, 2]  // Optional: List of course IDs to enroll the student in
  }
  ```

- **Response**: Returns the created student object with their enrolled courses.

#### Retrieve Students

- **Endpoint**: `GET /students/`
- **Query Parameters**: 
  - `skip`: Number of records to skip (for pagination).
  - `limit`: Number of records to return (default is 10).

- **Response**: Returns a list of students with their details and enrolled courses.

#### Create a Course

- **Endpoint**: `POST /courses/`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Mathematics",
    "level": "Intermediate"
  }
  ```

- **Response**: Returns the created course object.

#### Retrieve Courses

- **Endpoint**: `GET /courses/`
- **Query Parameters**: 
  - `skip`: Number of records to skip (for pagination).
  - `limit`: Number of records to return (default is 10).

- **Response**: Returns a list of available courses.

## Database Migration

The application uses SQLAlchemy to manage the database schema. The migration script ensures that the existing Student and Course data is preserved while adding a many-to-many relationship between Students and Courses.

### Database Structure

- **Students Table**: Contains student details.
- **Courses Table**: Contains course details.
- **Student_Courses Association Table**: Manages the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.

## Conclusion

This Student Course Management System provides a simple yet effective way to manage students and their courses. For further assistance, please refer to the code documentation or reach out to the support team.
