To satisfy the new customer's request for creating a Course entity, we should consider how best to present the information related to this entity. 

One option could be to use a **Document** format, which would allow us to clearly outline the Course entity's fields (name and level) in a structured manner. This could be beneficial for documentation purposes.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Dashboard** format, which would allow for a more interactive presentation of the Course data, especially if we plan to visualize multiple courses or provide additional functionalities in the future.

Another possibility is to create a **Website** that could serve as a platform for displaying the Course entity, allowing for easy access and potential integration with other features or entities.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the different modalities. 

Using a **Document** format is indeed a straightforward way to present the Course entity, but it may lack interactivity and scalability for future needs. 

The **Dashboard** option is appealing as it can provide real-time insights and a more engaging user experience, especially if we anticipate needing to display multiple courses or related data in the future.

Creating a **Website** could also be a strong choice, as it allows for a broader presentation of the Course entity and can be easily expanded with additional features or integrations down the line.

Considering the potential for future growth and interactivity, I lean towards the **Dashboard** format. It would allow us to present the Course entity effectively while also providing room for expansion. 

What do you think?

I agree with your assessment. The **Dashboard** format indeed offers a dynamic and interactive way to present the Course entity, making it easier to visualize and manage multiple courses as the project evolves. It also aligns well with our goal of providing real-time insights and enhancing user engagement.

Given the potential for future growth and the need for interactivity, I believe we should proceed with the **Dashboard** as our chosen product modality. 

If you are in agreement, we can finalize this decision.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, I will review the provided code against the regulations outlined. 

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Course` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical oversight as it directly affects the ability to create and manage Course entities.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods implemented for handling Course entities (e.g., creating, retrieving, updating, or deleting courses).

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Since there are no methods for the Course entity, this point is not applicable.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code for the Student entity appears to be functional, but without the Course entity, we cannot assess the overall robustness.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current implementation does not meet the user's requirements as the Course entity is missing.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation only allows for student management and does not include any functionality for courses.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the Course entity and its associated functionality. To fulfill the customer's requirements, we need to implement the Course model, schema, and corresponding routes.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course Model**: Add a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a Course Schema**: Add a new schema for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Add Routes for Course**: Update `routes.py` to include routes for creating and retrieving courses:
   ```python
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
   def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return courses
   ```

4. **Database Migration**: Ensure that the database schema is updated to include the new Course table. You may need to run a migration script if using a migration tool like Alembic.

5. **Update the GUI**: If you want to allow users to interact with the Course entity through the GUI, you will need to add corresponding fields and buttons in `gui.py`.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for managing Course entities alongside Student entities.

### Conclusion:
The current code does not fulfill the customer's requirements due to the absence of the Course entity. Implementing the suggested changes will ensure compliance with the task and enhance the application's functionality.

       db.commit()

       return db_course

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below:

### Summary of Changes
1. **Created a new `Course` model** in `models.py` with `name` and `level` fields.
2. **Added corresponding schemas** for Course creation and response in `schemas.py`.
3. **Updated `routes.py`** to include endpoints for creating and listing courses.
4. **Enhanced the GUI in `main.py`** to allow users to add and list courses.

This implementation meets the customer's requirements while ensuring that existing Student data is preserved during the database migration.

### Summary of Changes
1. **Created a new `Course` model** in `models.py` with `name` and `level` fields.
2. **Added corresponding schemas** for Course creation and response in `schemas.py`.
3. **Updated `routes.py`** to include endpoints for creating and listing courses.
4. **Enhanced the GUI in `main.py`** to allow users to add and list courses.

This implementation meets the customer's requirements while ensuring that existing Student data is preserved during the database migration.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for creating a Course entity and preserving existing Student data. However, I have identified a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration for Existing Data:**
The current implementation does not include a migration script to update the database schema to include the new Course table while preserving existing Student data. This is crucial to ensure that the application can operate seamlessly without losing any existing data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Add a Database Migration Script:**
   You need to create a migration script that will handle the addition of the new Course table to the existing database schema. This can be done using a migration tool like Alembic or by manually executing the necessary SQL commands.

2. **Implement the Migration Logic:**
   You can add a function in `database.py` to handle the migration. Here’s an example of how you might implement this:

   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData
   from sqlalchemy.schema import CreateTable

   def migrate_db():
       # Create a new engine instance
       engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
       metadata = MetaData(bind=engine)

       # Create the Course table
       Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)  # This will create the table if it doesn't exist
   ```

3. **Call the Migration Function:**
   Ensure that you call the `migrate_db()` function in your `main.py` or wherever you initialize your application, so that the migration occurs when the application starts.

4. **Testing:**
   After implementing the migration, test the application to ensure that both the Student and Course tables are accessible and that existing Student data remains intact.

### Conclusion:
By implementing the migration script and ensuring that it runs during application initialization, you will fulfill the requirement of preserving existing Student data while adding the new Course entity. This is essential for the application to function correctly without data loss.

If you implement these changes, the application will be compliant with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

   You can add a function in `database.py` to handle the migration. Here’s an example of how you might implement this:

   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData
   from sqlalchemy.schema import CreateTable

   def migrate_db():
       # Create a new engine instance
       engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
       metadata = MetaData(bind=engine)

       # Create the Course table
       Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)  # This will create the table if it doesn't exist
   ```

3. **Call the Migration Function:**
   Ensure that you call the `migrate_db()` function in your `main.py` or wherever you initialize your application, so that the migration occurs when the application starts.

4. **Testing:**
   After implementing the migration, test the application to ensure that both the Student and Course tables are accessible and that existing Student data remains intact.

### Conclusion:
By implementing the migration script and ensuring that it runs during application initialization, you will fulfill the requirement of preserving existing Student data while adding the new Course entity. This is essential for the application to function correctly without data loss.

If you implement these changes, the application will be compliant with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

After reviewing the provided code in detail according to the regulations set forth by ChatDev, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed.

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `init_db` function in `database.py` is not being called anywhere in the code. This means that the database schema, including the new `Course` table, will not be created unless this function is explicitly invoked. This could lead to runtime errors when trying to access the `Course` entity, as the table would not exist in the database.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. Call the `init_db()` function in the `main.py` file to ensure that the database schema is initialized when the application starts. This can be done by adding the following line at the beginning of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:

```python
from database import init_db

if __name__ == "__main__":
    init_db()  # Initialize the database
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = StudentApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
```

By implementing this change, you ensure that the database schema is created correctly, including the `Course` table, and that the application can operate as intended without any issues related to missing tables.

Please make this adjustment to ensure the application functions correctly.

This could lead to runtime errors when trying to access the Course entity, as the table would not exist in the database.\n\nSuggestions for Revision:*\n1. Call the init_db() function in the main.py file to ensure that the database schema is initialized when the application starts. This can be done by adding the following line at the beginning of the if __name__ == "__main__": block:\n\npython\nfrom database import init_db\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    init_db()  # Initialize the database\n    root = tk.Tk()\n    app = StudentApp(root)\n    root.mainloop()\n\n\nBy implementing this change, you ensure that the database schema is created correctly, including the Course table, and that the application can operate as intended without any issues related to missing tables.\n\nPlease make this adjustment to ensure the application functions correctly.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"After reviewing the provided code in detail according to the regulations set forth by ChatDev, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed.

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `init_db` function in `database.py` is not being called anywhere in the code. This means that the database schema, including the new `Course` table, will not be created unless this function is explicitly invoked. This could lead to runtime errors when trying to access the `Course` entity, as the table would not exist in the database.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. Call the `init_db()` function in the `main.py` file to ensure that the database schema is initialized when the application starts. This can be done by adding the following line at the beginning of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:

```python
from database import init_db

if __name__ == "__main__":
    init_db()  # Initialize the database
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = StudentApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
```

By implementing this change, you ensure that the database schema is created correctly, including the `Course` table, and that the application can operate as intended without any issues related to missing tables.

Please make this adjustment to ensure the application functions correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary adjustments made according to the comments provided. The `init_db()` function has been called in the `main.py` file to ensure that the database schema is initialized correctly.

```

These changes ensure that the application initializes the database correctly, including the new `Course` table, while preserving existing `Student` data.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, it appears that the project is using FastAPI for the web framework and SQLAlchemy for database interactions. Additionally, since the GUI is built using Tkinter, we will include that as well. Here’s a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Tkinter is included with Python's standard library, no version needed
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to create the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **requests**: Used for making HTTP requests to the API from the GUI.
- **tkinter**: The GUI framework, which is included with Python installations, so it doesn't require a specific version.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project requirements or the latest stable versions available at the time of deployment.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code, it appears that the project is using FastAPI for the web framework and SQLAlchemy for database interactions. Additionally, since the GUI is built using Tkinter, we will include that as well. Here’s a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Tkinter is included with Python's standard library, no version needed
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to create the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **requests**: Used for making HTTP requests to the API from the GUI.
- **tkinter**: The GUI framework, which is included with Python installations, so it doesn't require a specific version.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
