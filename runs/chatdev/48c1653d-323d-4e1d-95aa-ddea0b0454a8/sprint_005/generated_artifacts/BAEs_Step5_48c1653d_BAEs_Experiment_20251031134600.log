To address the customer's task of creating a Teacher entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. Given the simplicity of the data structure (name and email fields), we could opt for a few different modalities. 

1. **Document**: This could be a straightforward way to present the Teacher entity details in a structured format, but it may not be the most interactive option.

2. **Dashboard**: If we want to visualize multiple Teacher entities and potentially allow for real-time updates or interactions, a dashboard could be beneficial.

3. **Website**: This could provide a user-friendly interface to display the Teacher information, allowing for easy access and potential future expansion.

4. **Application**: If we want to create a more interactive experience, perhaps with functionalities like adding or editing Teacher entities, an application could be a good choice.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the various modalities. Here are my thoughts on each option:

1. **Document**: While it's simple and effective for presenting information, it lacks interactivity and may not be the best choice for future scalability.

2. **Dashboard**: This option allows for real-time updates and visual representation of data, which could be useful if we plan to manage multiple Teacher entities. However, it might be more complex than necessary for just displaying name and email.

3. **Website**: A website could provide a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to access Teacher information. It also allows for future enhancements, such as adding more features or integrating with other systems.

4. **Application**: This could offer a robust solution with interactive features, but it may be overkill for the current task of simply creating and displaying Teacher entities.

Considering the need for a balance between simplicity and future scalability, I lean towards the **Website** option. It provides a good user experience and allows for easy updates and expansions in the future. 

What do you think?

I agree with your assessment of the options. The **Website** modality strikes a good balance between user-friendliness and scalability. It allows us to present the Teacher entity information clearly while also providing the flexibility to expand features in the future, such as adding more entities or functionalities.

Given the simplicity of the current task and the potential for future growth, I believe the Website is indeed the most suitable choice. 

If you're in agreement, we can finalize our decision.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a few issues that need to be addressed to meet the requirements of creating a Teacher entity and ensuring that the database migration preserves existing data. Here are the detailed checks based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical oversight as the task requires creating a `Teacher` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for creating or retrieving `Teacher` entities in the `main.py` file.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for `Teacher` will also need comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code appears to be free of bugs, but without the `Teacher` entity, the application is incomplete.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current implementation does not conform to the user's task as the `Teacher` entity is missing.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: As it stands, the user cannot interact with a `Teacher` entity since it has not been implemented.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the `Teacher` entity, which is essential to fulfill the customer's requirements. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Teacher model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = "teachers"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)  # Ensure email is unique
   ```

2. **Create a Teacher schema in `schemas.py`**:
   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement CRUD operations for Teacher in `main.py`**:
   ```python
   @app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])
   def read_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return teachers
   ```

4. **Create a migration script for the Teacher table**:
   ```python
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   revision = 'add_teacher_table'
   down_revision = 'add_email_to_student'  # Update this to the last migration
   branch_labels = None
   depends_on = None

   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False, unique=True)
       )

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_table('teachers')
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating a `Teacher` entity and ensure that the database migration preserves existing data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the project is complete and functional.

       email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)  # Ensure email is unique
   ```

2. **Create a Teacher schema in `schemas.py`**:
   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement CRUD operations for Teacher in `main.py`**:
   ```python
   @app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])
   def read_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return teachers
   ```

4. **Create a migration script for the Teacher table**:
   ```python
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   revision = 'add_teacher_table'
   down_revision = 'add_email_to_student'  # Update this to the last migration
   branch_labels = None
   depends_on = None

   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False, unique=True)
       )

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_table('teachers')
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating a `Teacher` entity and ensure that the database migration preserves existing data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the project is complete and functional.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a few issues that need to be addressed to meet the requirements of creating a Teacher entity and ensuring that the database migration preserves existing data. Here are the detailed checks based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical oversight as the task requires creating a `Teacher` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for creating or retrieving `Teacher` entities in the `main.py` file.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for `Teacher` will also need comments.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code appears to be free of bugs, but without the `Teacher` entity, the application is incomplete.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current implementation does not conform to the user's task as the `Teacher` entity is missing.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: As it stands, the user cannot interact with a `Teacher` entity since it has not been implemented.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the `Teacher` entity, which is essential to fulfill the customer's requirements. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Teacher model in `models.py`**:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = "teachers"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)  # Ensure email is unique
   ```

2. **Create a Teacher schema in `schemas.py`**:
   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement CRUD operations for Teacher in `main.py`**:
   ```python
   @app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])
   def read_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return teachers
   ```

4. **Create a migration script for the Teacher table**:
   ```python
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   revision = 'add_teacher_table'
   down_revision = 'add_email_to_student'  # Update this to the last migration
   branch_labels = None

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating a `Teacher` entity and ensure that the database migration preserves existing data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the project is complete and functional."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

This is a critical oversight as the task requires creating a Teacher entity.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: There are no methods for creating or retrieving Teacher entities in the main.py file.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for Teacher will also need comments.\n\n4. No potential bugs: The existing code appears to be free of bugs, but without the Teacher entity, the application is incomplete.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The current implementation does not conform to the user\'s task as the Teacher entity is missing.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: As it stands, the user cannot interact with a Teacher entity since it has not been implemented.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the absence of the Teacher entity, which is essential to fulfill the customer\'s requirements. \n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Create a Teacher model in models.py:\n   python\n   class Teacher(Base):\n       __tablename__ = "teachers"\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)  # Ensure email is unique\n\n\n2. Create a Teacher schema in schemas.py:\n   python\n   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       email: EmailStr\n\n   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       email: EmailStr\n\n       class Config:\n           orm_mode = True\n\n\n3. Implement CRUD operations for Teacher in main.py:\n   python\n   @app.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)\n   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)\n       db.add(db_teacher)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_teacher)\n       return db_teacher\n\n   @app.get("/teachers/", response_model=list[TeacherResponse])\n   def read_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()\n       return teachers\n\n\n4. Create a migration script for the Teacher table:\n   python\n   from alembic import op\n   import sqlalchemy as sa\n\n   revision = \'add_teacher_table\'\n   down_revision = \'add_email_to_student\'  # Update this to the last migration\n   branch_labels = None\n   depends_on = None\n\n   def upgrade():\n       op.create_table(\n           \'teachers\',\n           sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),\n           sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n           sa.Column(\'email\', sa.String(), nullable=False, unique=True)\n       )\n\n   def downgrade():\n       op.drop_table(\'teachers\')\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer\'s requirements for creating a Teacher entity and ensure that the database migration preserves existing data. \n\nPlease proceed with these revisions to ensure the project is complete and functional.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed:

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script for adding the `Teacher` table (`migration.py`) should be executed after the existing migration that adds the `email` field to the `Student` table. However, the `down_revision` in the `migration.py` file is set to `add_email_to_student`, which is correct, but you need to ensure that the migration scripts are executed in the correct order. Additionally, the `email` field in the `Student` model is initially set to `nullable=True`, which contradicts the requirement of being a required field. This could lead to inconsistencies in the database.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `email` field in the `Student` model**: Change `nullable=True` to `nullable=False` to ensure that the email is required.
   
   ```python
   email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Change to nullable=False
   ```

2. **Ensure Migration Order**: Make sure that the migration for adding the `Teacher` table is executed after the migration for adding the `email` field to the `Student` table. You can verify this by checking the migration history in your database.

3. **Run Migrations**: After making the above changes, ensure to run the migrations again to apply the changes to the database schema.

4. **Testing**: After making these changes, thoroughly test the application to ensure that both the `Student` and `Teacher` entities are functioning as expected, and that the email field is enforced as required.

By addressing these issues, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements and functions correctly without any potential bugs.

### Summary of Changes:
- Change `nullable=True` to `nullable=False` for the `email` field in the `Student` model.
- Verify and ensure the correct order of migration execution.

Please implement these changes to ensure compliance with the requirements.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script for adding the `Teacher` table (`migration.py`) is dependent on the previous migration (`add_email_to_student`), which is correct. However, the migration script for adding the email field to the `Student` table (`add_email_to_student`) does not have a corresponding migration that ensures the existing data is preserved correctly. The `email` field in the `Student` model is set to `nullable=True`, which is acceptable for the initial migration, but it should be updated to `nullable=False` in the final schema to ensure data integrity.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `email` field in the `Student` model** to `nullable=False` after the migration that adds the email field is applied. This ensures that all students must have an email address.
2. **Create a new migration script** that updates the `email` field in the `students` table to `nullable=False` after ensuring that all existing records have valid email addresses.

### Instructions to Fix:
1. Create a new migration script (e.g., `make_email_non_nullable.py`) with the following content:
   ```python
   '''
   Migration script to make email field non-nullable in Student table.
   '''
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
   revision = 'make_email_non_nullable'
   down_revision = 'add_teacher_table'  # Update this to the last migration
   branch_labels = None
   depends_on = None

   def upgrade():
       # Ensure all existing records have valid emails before making the column non-nullable
       op.alter_column('students', 'email', existing_type=sa.String(), nullable=False)

   def downgrade():
       op.alter_column('students', 'email', existing_type=sa.String(), nullable=True)
   ```

2. Run the migration to apply the changes to the database schema.

3. Update the `models.py` file to reflect the change in the `Student` model:
   ```python
   email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)  # Ensure email is unique and not nullable
   ```

By following these steps, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements and maintains data integrity.

If you implement these changes, the code will be in compliance with the user's requirements and the regulations set by ChatDev.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# Teacher Management System

A simple web application for managing teachers, students, and courses.

## Overview

The Teacher Management System allows users to create and manage entities for teachers, students, and courses. This application is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, providing a RESTful API for easy interaction with the database.

## Main Functions

- **Create Teacher**: Add a new teacher with a name and email.
- **Read Teachers**: Retrieve a list of all teachers.
- **Create Student**: Add a new student with a name and email.
- **Read Students**: Retrieve a list of all students.
- **Create Course**: Add a new course with a name and level.
- **Read Courses**: Retrieve a list of all courses.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   fastapi
   sqlalchemy
   alembic
   pydantic
   uvicorn
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**:
   To create the necessary database tables, run the following command:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Start the Application**:
   Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Usage

To create a new teacher, send a POST request to `/teachers/` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### Retrieving Teachers

To retrieve a list of all teachers, send a GET request to `/teachers/`.

### Creating a Student

To create a new student, send a POST request to `/students/` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
}
```

### Retrieving Students

To retrieve a list of all students, send a GET request to `/students/`.

### Creating a Course

To create a new course, send a POST request to `/courses/` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "Mathematics",
  "level": "Beginner"
