To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be a **Dashboard**, as it can visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time, allowing for an interactive experience. This could be beneficial for administrators to track student enrollments and course participation.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Document** format, which would allow us to provide detailed descriptions of the relationships and any necessary documentation regarding the schema changes and migration processes.

Another possibility is an **Application**, where we could create a tool that allows users to manage student-course relationships dynamically, providing a more hands-on approach to the data.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I see the value in each of those options. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a real-time visualization of the relationships, making it easier for users to understand the data at a glance. It could also allow for filtering and sorting, which would enhance usability.

On the other hand, a **Document** would be great for providing comprehensive details about the implementation, including the database schema changes and migration strategies. This could serve as a reference for developers and stakeholders.

The **Application** option is also compelling, as it would allow for direct interaction with the data, enabling users to add, modify, or remove course relationships in a user-friendly interface.

Ultimately, it depends on whether we prioritize visualization and interactivity (Dashboard), detailed documentation (Document), or a hands-on management tool (Application). 

I personally lean towards the **Dashboard** for its interactive capabilities, but I'm open to hearing your preference. What do you think?

I appreciate your insights on the options. I agree that the **Dashboard** offers significant advantages in terms of real-time visualization and interactivity, which can greatly enhance user engagement and understanding of the student-course relationships. 

While the **Document** is valuable for providing detailed information, and the **Application** allows for direct management, I believe the Dashboard's ability to present data dynamically and visually aligns well with the customer's needs for tracking and managing relationships effectively.

Given our discussion and the merits of the Dashboard, I would support moving forward with that option. Shall we finalize our choice?

Requirements:

- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided does not currently implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. This is a critical oversight as it directly contradicts the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Implementation:** The `Student` model should have a relationship with the `Course` model to allow students to have courses. This can be achieved by adding a many-to-many relationship using an association table.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create an Association Table:** Define a new table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.
2. **Update the `Student` and `Course` Models:** Modify the `Student` and `Course` models to include the relationship.

Here’s how you can implement these changes:

#### Update `models.py`
```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

#### Update `schemas.py`
You may also want to update the `StudentResponse` schema to include the courses associated with a student:
```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: List[CourseResponse] = []  # Add this line to include courses
    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

#### Update Database Migration
You will need to ensure that the database migration script can handle the creation of the new association table. The `upgrade` function in `main.py` should remain the same since `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)` will create the necessary tables.

### Final Note:
After implementing these changes, ensure to run the migration to create the new association table in the database while preserving existing data.

By following these suggestions, the code will meet the requirements of the task and allow students to have courses as specified by the customer.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided does not currently implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. This is a critical oversight as it directly contradicts the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Implementation:** The `Student` model should have a relationship with the `Course` model to allow students to have courses. This can be achieved by adding a many-to-many relationship using an association table.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create an Association Table:** Define a new table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.
2. **Update the `Student` and `Course` Models:** Modify the `Student` and `Course` models to include the relationship.

Here’s how you can implement these changes:

#### Update `models.py`
```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

#### Update `schemas.py`
You may also want to update the `StudentResponse` schema to include the courses associated with a student:
```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: List[CourseResponse] = []  # Add this line to include courses
    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

#### Update Database Migration
You will need to ensure that the database migration script can handle the creation of the new association table. The `upgrade` function in `main.py` should remain the same since `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)` will create the necessary tables.

### Final Note:
After implementing these changes, ensure to run the migration to create the new association table in the database while preserving existing data.

By following these suggestions, the code will meet the requirements of the task and allow students to have courses as specified by the customer.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

This can be achieved by adding a many-to-many relationship using an association table.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Create an Association Table: Define a new table to represent the many-to-many relationship between Student and Course.\n2. Update the Student and Course Models: Modify the Student and Course models to include the relationship.\n\nHere’s how you can implement these changes:\n\n#### Update models.py\npython\nfrom sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n\n# Association table for the many-to-many relationship\nstudent_courses = Table(\n    \'student_courses\',\n    Base.metadata,\n    Column(\'student_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n    Column(\'course_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n)\n\nclass Student(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'students\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")\n\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n\n\n#### Update schemas.py\nYou may also want to update the StudentResponse schema to include the courses associated with a student:\npython\nclass StudentResponse(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    email: str\n    courses: List[CourseResponse] = []  # Add this line to include courses\n    class Config:\n        orm_mode = True\n\n\n#### Update Database Migration\nYou will need to ensure that the database migration script can handle the creation of the new association table. The upgrade function in main.py should remain the same since Base.metadata.create_all(engine) will create the necessary tables.\n\n### Final Note:\nAfter implementing these changes, ensure to run the migration to create the new association table in the database while preserving existing data.\n\nBy following these suggestions, the code will meet the requirements of the task and allow students to have courses as specified by the customer.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask!'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure that the implementation is complete and robust. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The `main.py` file currently only creates tables if they do not exist. However, it does not handle the migration of existing data or the addition of the new many-to-many relationship table (`student_courses`). This could lead to data loss or inconsistency if the database schema is altered without proper migration handling.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Implement a Migration Strategy:**
   - Use a migration tool like Alembic to handle schema changes and data migrations properly. This will allow you to manage changes to the database schema without losing existing data.
   - If you want to keep it simple, you can manually check if the `student_courses` table exists and create it if it does not, but this is not recommended for production environments.

2. **Update the `upgrade()` function in `main.py`:**
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       # Create all tables if they do not exist
       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
       # Check if the student_courses table exists, if not create it
       if not engine.dialect.has_table(engine, 'student_courses'):
           student_courses.create(bind=engine)
   ```

3. **Add a `downgrade()` function:**
   - Implement a downgrade function to drop the `student_courses` table if needed, which is useful for rollback scenarios.

### Example Downgrade Function:
```python
def downgrade():
    # Drop the association table if it exists
    if engine.dialect.has_table(engine, 'student_courses'):
        student_courses.drop(bind=engine)
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing a robust migration strategy, you ensure that the application can evolve without losing existing data or functionality. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the application as it scales.

Please make these changes to the `main.py` file and consider using a migration tool for future schema changes. 

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure that the implementation is complete and robust. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The `main.py` file currently only creates tables if they do not exist. However, it does not handle the migration of existing data or the addition of the new many-to-many relationship table (`student_courses`). This could lead to data loss or inconsistency if the database schema is altered without proper migration handling.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Implement a Migration Strategy:**
   - Use a migration tool like Alembic to handle schema changes and data migrations properly. This will allow you to manage changes to the database schema without losing existing data.
   - If you want to keep it simple, you can manually check if the `student_courses` table exists and create it if it does not, but this is not recommended for production environments.

2. **Update the `upgrade()` function in `main.py`:**
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       # Create all tables if they do not exist
       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
       # Check if the student_courses table exists, if not create it
       if not engine.dialect.has_table(engine, 'student_courses'):
           student_courses.create(bind=engine)
   ```

3. **Add a `downgrade()` function:**
   - Implement a downgrade function to drop the `student_courses` table if needed, which is useful for rollback scenarios.

### Example Downgrade Function:
```python
def downgrade():
    # Drop the association table if it exists
    if engine.dialect.has_table(engine, 'student_courses'):
        student_courses.drop(bind=engine)
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing a robust migration strategy, you ensure that the application can evolve without losing existing data or functionality. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the application as it scales.

Please make these changes to the `main.py` file and consider using a migration tool for future schema changes. 

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure that the implementation is complete and robust. \n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nDatabase Migration Logic:\nThe main.py file currently only creates tables if they do not exist. However, it does not handle the migration of existing data or the addition of the new many-to-many relationship table (student_courses). This could lead to data loss or inconsistency if the database schema is altered without proper migration handling.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Implement a Migration Strategy:\n   - Use a migration tool like Alembic to handle schema changes and data migrations properly. This will allow you to manage changes to the database schema without losing existing data.\n   - If you want to keep it simple, you can manually check if the student_courses table exists and create it if it does not, but this is not recommended for production environments.\n\n2. Update the upgrade() function in main.py:\n   python\n   def upgrade():\n       # Create all tables if they do not exist\n       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n       # Check if the student_courses table exists, if not create it\n       if not engine.dialect.has_table(engine, 'student_courses'):\n           student_courses.create(bind=engine)\n\n\n3. Add a downgrade() function:\n   - Implement a downgrade function to drop the student_courses table if needed, which is useful for rollback scenarios.\n\n### Example Downgrade Function:\npython\ndef downgrade():\n    # Drop the association table if it exists\n    if engine.dialect.has_table(engine, 'student_courses'):\n        student_courses.drop(bind=engine)\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy implementing a robust migration strategy, you ensure that the application can evolve without losing existing data or functionality. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the application as it scales.\n\nPlease make these changes to the main.py file and consider using a migration tool for future schema changes. \n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"} |

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. However, there are a few areas that need attention, particularly regarding the database migration and the handling of existing data.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `upgrade` function in `main.py` does not handle the preservation of existing data during the migration process. While it creates the necessary tables, it does not check for existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables before creating the `student_courses` association table. This could lead to data integrity issues if the tables already exist.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade` function** to ensure that it only creates the `student_courses` table if it does not already exist, and ensure that it does not disrupt existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Check if the student_courses table exists, if not create it
    if not engine.dialect.has_table(engine, 'student_courses'):
        # Create the association table without affecting existing data
        student_courses.create(bind=engine)
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that you have proper error handling in place for database operations.
- Consider adding tests to verify that the relationships between `Student` and `Course` are functioning as expected after the migration.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process is robust and that existing data is preserved.

If you make these adjustments, the code will be more reliable and compliant with the requirements.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided test reports and the traceback, the issue arises from the way the `has_table` method is being called in the `upgrade` function of `main.py`. Here’s a summary of the bugs causing the problem:

### Bug Summary:

1. **Incorrect Usage of `has_table` Method**:
   - The error message indicates that the `has_table` method is being called incorrectly. The method expects a `Connection` object, but it is being passed an `Engine` object instead.
   - The correct usage of `has_table` should involve using the `inspect` function from SQLAlchemy to check for the existence of the table.

### Suggested Fix:

To resolve the issue, you should modify the `upgrade` function in `main.py` to use the `inspect` function correctly. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, inspect
from models import Base, student_courses

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Use inspect to check if the student_courses table exists
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    if 'student_courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        student_courses.create(bind=engine)

def downgrade():
    # Drop the association table if it exists
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    if 'student_courses' in inspector.get_table_names():
        student_courses.drop(bind=engine)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    upgrade()
```

### Key Changes:
- Import the `inspect` function from SQLAlchemy.
- Create an inspector object using `inspect(engine)`.
- Use `inspector.get_table_names()` to check if the `student_courses` table exists.

By implementing these changes, the code should correctly check for the existence of the `student_courses` table and avoid the `ArgumentError` encountered during execution.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"Based on the provided test reports and the traceback, the issue arises from the way the `has_table` method is being called in the `upgrade` function of `main.py`. Here’s a summary of the bugs causing the problem:

### Bug Summary:

1. **Incorrect Usage of `has_table` Method**:
   - The error message indicates that the `has_table` method is being called incorrectly. The method expects a `Connection` object, but it is being passed an `Engine` object instead.
   - The correct usage of `has_table` should involve using the `inspect` function from SQLAlchemy to check for the existence of the table.

### Suggested Fix:

To resolve the issue, you should modify the `upgrade` function in `main.py` to use the `inspect` function correctly. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, inspect
from models import Base, student_courses

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Use inspect to check if the student_courses table exists
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    if 'student_courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        student_courses.create(bind=engine)

def downgrade():
    # Drop the association table if it exists
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    if 'student_courses' in inspector.get_table_names():
        student_courses.drop(bind=engine)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    upgrade()
```

### Key Changes:
- Import the `inspect` function from SQLAlchemy.
- Create an inspector object using `inspect(engine)`.
- Use `inspector.get_table_names()` to check if the `student_courses` table exists.

By implementing these changes, the code should correctly check for the existence of the `student_courses` table and avoid the `ArgumentError` encountered during execution."

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, the `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary dependencies for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and any other relevant packages. Here’s how the `requirements.txt` file would look:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used for building the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization with FastAPI.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers according to your specific project needs or the latest stable versions available at the time of your implementation.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, the `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary dependencies for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and any other relevant packages. Here’s how the `requirements.txt` file would look:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used for building the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization with FastAPI.
Make sure to adjust the version numbers according to your specific project needs or the latest stable versions available at the time of your implementation. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Student-Course Management System

A simple API for managing students and their course enrollments.

## Overview

This software provides a RESTful API to manage students and courses, allowing students to enroll in multiple courses. It is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, and it supports a many-to-many relationship between students and courses.

## Main Functions

- **Create a Student**: Add a new student to the system.
- **Read Student Details**: Retrieve details of a specific student, including their enrolled courses.
- **Create a Course**: Add a new course to the system.
- **Read Course Details**: Retrieve details of a specific course.
- **Enroll Student in Course**: Enroll a student in a specific course.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-course-management.git
   cd student-course-management
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**:
   The database will be automatically created when you run the application for the first time. However, you can manually run the migration script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
