To address the customer's task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be a **Dashboard**, which would allow us to visualize the relationships between Courses and Teachers in real-time, making it easy to manage and oversee the data. 

Alternatively, a **Document** could provide a detailed explanation of the changes made, including the updated database schema and migration steps, which could be useful for documentation purposes.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you see any other modalities that might be more suitable for this task?

I appreciate your suggestions. A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic way to visualize the relationship between Courses and Teachers, allowing for real-time updates and management. However, I also see the value in a **Document** for thorough documentation of the changes, which is crucial for maintaining clarity and understanding of the database schema updates.

Another option to consider could be an **Application** that allows users to interact with the Courses and Teachers, providing a hands-on approach to managing these relationships.

Ultimately, I believe we should focus on the modality that best serves the customer's needs for both visualization and documentation. 

What do you think about combining the strengths of a **Dashboard** for visualization and a **Document** for detailed documentation? Or do you prefer to focus on one modality?

I agree that combining the strengths of a **Dashboard** for visualization and a **Document** for detailed documentation could provide a comprehensive solution to the customer's needs. The Dashboard would allow users to interact with and visualize the relationships in real-time, while the Document would serve as a reference for the changes made to the database schema and migration process.

However, if we must choose a single modality, I lean towards the **Dashboard** as it offers a more interactive and engaging way to manage the Course and Teacher relationship, which could be more beneficial for users in the long run.

What are your final thoughts? Should we go with the **Dashboard** as our primary modality, or do you still prefer to consider the Document as well?

I appreciate your insights and agree that the **Dashboard** would be the most beneficial primary modality for this task. Its interactive nature will allow users to visualize and manage the Course and Teacher relationships effectively, which aligns well with the customer's needs for real-time data management.

While the Document is important for thorough documentation, I believe we can prioritize the Dashboard for its engaging and practical application. We can always create the Document as a supplementary resource later if needed.

Let's finalize our decision.

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity and ensuring that the system operates correctly.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `Course` model does not currently have a relationship defined to the `Teacher` entity, which is essential to fulfill the requirement of allowing a course to have a teacher. This relationship needs to be established in the `models.py` file.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py`** to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` entity. This will establish the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`.

Here’s how you can modify the `Course` model:

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line for the relationship
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model in `models.py`** to include a relationship back to `Course`:

```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas in `schemas.py`** to include the `teacher_id` field:

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to accept teacher_id when creating a course

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to include teacher_id in the response
    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

4. **Update the `create_course` function in `routers.py`** to handle the `teacher_id` when creating a course:

```python
@router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line
    db.add(db_course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_course)
    return db_course
```

### Database Migration:
Since you need to preserve existing data, ensure that the database migration logic in `main.py` is updated to include the new `teacher_id` column in the `courses` table. You may need to use a migration tool like Alembic to handle this properly, as SQLite does not support altering tables directly.

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, you will successfully add the teacher relationship to the Course entity, allowing for the required functionality while preserving existing data. 

Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application meets the customer's requirements effectively.

1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py`** to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` entity. This will establish the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`.

Here’s how you can modify the `Course` model:

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line for the relationship
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model in `models.py`** to include a relationship back to `Course`:

```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas in `schemas.py`** to include the `teacher_id` field:

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to accept teacher_id when creating a course

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to include teacher_id in the response
    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

4. **Update the `create_course` function in `routers.py`** to handle the `teacher_id` when creating a course:

```python
@router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line
    db.add(db_course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_course)
    return db_course
```

### Database Migration:
Since you need to preserve existing data, ensure that the database migration logic in `main.py` is updated to include the new `teacher_id` column in the `courses` table. You may need to use a migration tool like Alembic to handle this properly, as SQLite does not support altering tables directly.

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, you will successfully add the teacher relationship to the Course entity, allowing for the required functionality while preserving existing data. 

Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application meets the customer's requirements effectively.

"The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity and ensuring that the system operates correctly.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `Course` model does not currently have a relationship defined to the `Teacher` entity, which is essential to fulfill the requirement of allowing a course to have a teacher. This relationship needs to be established in the `models.py` file.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py`** to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` entity. This will establish the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`.

Here’s how you can modify the `Course` model:

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line for the relationship
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
    teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model in `models.py`** to include a relationship back to `Course`:

```python
class Teacher(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teachers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line to establish the relationship
```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas in `schemas.py`** to include the `teacher_id` field:

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to accept teacher_id when creating a course

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str
    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to include teacher_id in the response
    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

4. **Update the `create_course` function in `routers.py`** to handle the `teacher_id` when creating a course:

```python
@router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line
    db.add(db_course)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_course)
    return db_course
```

### Database Migration:
Since you need to preserve existing data, ensure that the database migration logic in `main.py` is updated to include the new `teacher_id` column in the `courses` table. You may need to use a migration tool like Alembic to handle this properly, as SQLite does not support altering tables directly.

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, you will successfully add the teacher relationship to the Course entity, allowing for the required functionality while preserving existing data. 

Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application meets the customer's requirements effectively."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes according to the comments provided, ensuring that the teacher relationship is added to the Course entity while preserving existing data.

This relationship needs to be established in the models.py file.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Update the Course model in models.py to include a foreign key reference to the Teacher entity. This will establish the relationship between Course and Teacher.\n\nHere’s how you can modify the Course model:\n\npython\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\'teachers.id\'))  # Add this line for the relationship\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n    teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line to establish the relationship\n\n\n2. Update the Teacher model in models.py to include a relationship back to Course:\n\npython\nclass Teacher(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \'teachers\'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line to establish the relationship\n\n\n3. Update the CourseCreate and CourseResponse schemas in schemas.py to include the teacher_id field:\n\npython\nclass CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n    level: str\n    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to accept teacher_id when creating a course\n\nclass CourseResponse(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    level: str\n    teacher_id: int  # Add this line to include teacher_id in the response\n    class Config:\n        orm_mode = True\n\n\n4. Update the create_course function in routers.py to handle the teacher_id when creating a course:\n\npython\n@router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)\ndef create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line\n    db.add(db_course)\n    db.commit()\n    db.refresh(db_course)\n    return db_course\n\n\n### Database Migration:\nSince you need to preserve existing data, ensure that the database migration logic in main.py is updated to include the new teacher_id column in the courses table. You may need to use a migration tool like Alembic to handle this properly, as SQLite does not support altering tables directly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy implementing these changes, you will successfully add the teacher relationship to the Course entity, allowing for the required functionality while preserving existing data. \n\nPlease proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the application meets the customer\'s requirements effectively.'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements outlined in the task. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the implementation is robust and fully functional.

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `upgrade` function in `main.py` does not handle the migration of existing data when adding the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table. This could lead to data integrity issues if the `courses` table already contains data without a corresponding `teacher_id`. 

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Modify the `upgrade` function** to include a migration step that adds the `teacher_id` column to the existing `courses` table without losing any existing data. You can use SQLAlchemy's `ALTER TABLE` functionality to achieve this.

Here is an example of how you might modify the `upgrade` function:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, ForeignKey, alter

def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Use inspect to check if the student_courses table exists
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    if 'student_courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        student_courses.create(bind=engine)
    
    # Add the Teacher table creation
    if 'teachers' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=engine)

    # Check if the 'teacher_id' column exists in the 'courses' table
    if 'courses' in inspector.get_table_names():
        if 'teacher_id' not in [column['name'] for column in inspector.get_columns('courses')]:
            # Add the teacher_id column to the existing courses table
            with engine.connect() as connection:
                connection.execute('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER')

    # Ensure that existing Student and Course data is preserved
    if inspector.get_table_names() == ['students', 'courses', 'student_courses']:
        print("Existing Student and Course data is preserved.")
```

This change ensures that the `teacher_id` column is added to the `courses` table without losing any existing data. 

Please implement this change to ensure that the migration process is robust and maintains data integrity. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements outlined in the task. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the implementation is robust and fully functional.

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `upgrade` function in `main.py` does not handle the migration of existing data when adding the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table. This could lead to data integrity issues if the `courses` table already contains data without a corresponding `teacher_id`. 

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Modify the `upgrade` function** to include a migration step that adds the `teacher_id` column to the existing `courses` table without losing any existing data. You can use SQLAlchemy's `ALTER TABLE` functionality to achieve this.

Here is an example of how you might modify the `upgrade` function:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, ForeignKey, alter

def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Use inspect to check if the student_courses table exists
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    if 'student_courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        student_courses.create(bind=engine)
    
    # Add the Teacher table creation
    if 'teachers' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=engine)

    # Check if the 'teacher_id' column exists in the 'courses' table
    if 'courses' in inspector.get_table_names():
        if 'teacher_id' not in [column['name'] for column in inspector.get_columns('courses')]:
            # Add the teacher_id column to the existing courses table
            with engine.connect() as connection:
                connection.execute('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER')

    # Ensure that existing Student and Course data is preserved
    if inspector.get_table_names() == ['students', 'courses', 'student_courses']:
        print("Existing Student and Course data is preserved.")
```

This change ensures that the `teacher_id` column is added to the `courses` table without losing any existing data. 

Please implement this change to ensure that the migration process is robust and maintains data integrity. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary changes implemented according to the comments provided. The `upgrade` function in `main.py` has been updated to include the migration step for adding the `teacher_id` column to the existing `courses` table without losing any existing data.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements set forth by the customer. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the application functions correctly and meets all the specified requirements.

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `upgrade` function in `main.py` does not handle the migration of existing data properly when adding the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table. Specifically, using `ALTER TABLE` in SQLite does not allow for adding a column with a default value, which could lead to issues if there are existing records in the `courses` table. This could result in `teacher_id` being `NULL` for existing courses, which may not be the intended behavior.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Data Migration Strategy:** Instead of directly adding the `teacher_id` column with `ALTER TABLE`, consider creating a new table with the desired schema, copying the data from the old table, and then renaming the new table to the original name. This way, you can ensure that the data integrity is maintained and that the new column is properly populated.

2. **Update the `upgrade` function:** Modify the `upgrade` function to handle the migration of existing data correctly. Here’s a suggested approach:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Use inspect to check if the student_courses table exists
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    if 'student_courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        student_courses.create(bind=engine)
    
    # Add the Teacher table creation
    if 'teachers' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=engine)
    
    # Check if the 'teacher_id' column exists in the 'courses' table
    if 'courses' in inspector.get_table_names():
        if 'teacher_id' not in [column['name'] for column in inspector.get_columns('courses')]:
            # Create a new table with the desired schema
            with engine.connect() as connection:
                connection.execute('CREATE TABLE courses_new (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, level TEXT NOT NULL, teacher_id INTEGER)')
                # Copy data from the old table to the new table
                connection.execute('INSERT INTO courses_new (id, name, level) SELECT id, name, level FROM courses')
                # Drop the old table
                connection.execute('DROP TABLE courses')
                # Rename the new table to the original name
                connection.execute('ALTER TABLE courses_new RENAME TO courses')
    
    # Ensure that existing Student and Course data is preserved
    if inspector.get_table_names() == ['students', 'courses', 'student_courses']:
        print("Existing Student and Course data is preserved.")
```

This approach ensures that the existing data in the `courses` table is preserved while adding the new `teacher_id` column.

**Final Note:**
Make sure to test the migration process thoroughly in a development environment before deploying it to production to ensure that all data is preserved and that the application behaves as expected.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

- **Enrollment**: Enroll students in courses and manage their course selections.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatdev-course-management.git
   cd chatdev-course-management
   ```

   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## How to Use the Software

### API Endpoints

The application exposes several API endpoints to interact with the system. Below are the main endpoints you can use:

#### Student Endpoints

- **Create a Student**:
  - **POST** `/students/`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```

- **Get a Student**:
  - **GET** `/students/{student_id}`

#### Course Endpoints

- **Create a Course**:
  - **POST** `/courses/`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "level": "Beginner",
      "teacher_id": 1  // ID of the teacher associated with the course
    }
    ```

- **Get a Course**:
  - **GET** `/courses/{course_id}`

#### Teacher Endpoints

- **Create a Teacher**:
  - **POST** `/teachers/`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
    }
    ```

- **Get a Teacher**:
  - **GET** `/teachers/{teacher_id}`

#### Enrollment

- **Enroll a Student in a Course**:
  - **POST** `/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}`

### Database Migration
