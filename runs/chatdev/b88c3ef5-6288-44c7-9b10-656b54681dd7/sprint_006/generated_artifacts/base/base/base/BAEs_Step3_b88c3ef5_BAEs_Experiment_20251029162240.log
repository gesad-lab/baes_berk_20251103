To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. Given the simplicity of the data structure (name and level fields), I believe a straightforward approach would be beneficial.

1. **Document**: This could be a good option as it allows for a structured presentation of the Course entity, including descriptions and details about the fields.

2. **Website**: A web-based presentation could allow for interactive elements, such as forms to input course data, which might be useful for users to visualize and manage courses.

3. **Dashboard**: If we want to visualize multiple courses and their levels, a dashboard could provide a real-time overview and allow for easy management of course data.

What are your thoughts on these modalities?

I appreciate your insights on the potential modalities. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Document**: While it provides a structured format, it may lack interactivity and real-time data management capabilities.

2. **Website**: This option offers interactivity and could be user-friendly for managing course data. It allows for easy updates and visual representation.

3. **Dashboard**: This is great for visualizing multiple courses, but it might be more complex than necessary for the simple task at hand.

Considering the need for a straightforward presentation of the Course entity while also allowing for potential future interactions, I lean towards the **Website** option. It strikes a good balance between simplicity and functionality.

What do you think?

I agree with your assessment. The **Website** modality indeed provides a user-friendly interface that allows for easy management and interaction with the Course entity. It also offers the flexibility to expand in the future if we decide to add more features or functionalities.

Given the straightforward nature of the task and the potential for future enhancements, I believe we have reached a consensus on using the Website as our product modality.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided does not currently implement the Course entity as specified in the user's task. Below is a detailed review based on the regulations provided:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Course` model and schema are missing. We need to create these and import them in the necessary files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for handling Course entities (CRUD operations) in the `routers.py` file.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods in `routers.py` have comments, but we need to add comments for the new Course methods.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code does not contain bugs, but it is incomplete for the Course entity.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not currently conform to the user's task as the Course entity is not implemented.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: As it stands, the software does not allow interaction with the Course entity.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The highest priority issue is that the Course entity is not implemented at all, which is a critical requirement of the task. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course Model**: Add a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Course Schemas**: Add schemas for Course creation and response in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement Course Routes**: Add routes for the Course entity in `routers.py`:
   ```python
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @router.get("/courses/{course_id}", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def read_course(course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
       if db_course is None:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Course not found")
       return db_course
   ```

4. **Update Database Migration**: Modify the migration logic in `main.py` to create the Course table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
       # Create the courses table
       Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)
   ```

By implementing these changes, the software will meet the user's requirements and allow for interaction with the Course entity.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the Course entity is fully integrated into the application.

[2025-29-10 16:23:08 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided does not currently implement the Course entity as specified in the user's task. Below is a detailed review based on the regulations provided:

### Highest Priority Comment:
The highest priority issue is that the Course entity is not implemented at all, which is a critical requirement of the task. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course Model**: Add a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Course Schemas**: Add schemas for Course creation and response in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement Course Routes**: Add routes for the Course entity in `routers.py`:
   ```python
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @router.get("/courses/{course_id}", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def read_course(course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
       if db_course is None:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Course not found")
       return db_course
   ```

4. **Update Database Migration**: Modify the migration logic in `main.py` to create the Course table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
       # Create the courses table
       Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)
   ```

By implementing these changes, the software will meet the user's requirements and allow for interaction with the Course entity.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the Course entity is fully integrated into the application.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided does not currently implement the Course entity as specified in the user's task. Below is a detailed review based on the regulations provided:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Course` model and schema are missing. We need to create these and import them in the necessary files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for handling Course entities (CRUD operations) in the `routers.py` file.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods in `routers.py` have comments, but we need to add comments for the new Course methods.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code does not contain bugs, but it is incomplete for the Course entity.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not currently conform to the user's task as the Course entity is not implemented.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: As it stands, the software does not allow interaction with the Course entity.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The highest priority issue is that the Course entity is not implemented at all, which is a critical requirement of the task. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course Model**: Add a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Course Schemas**: Add schemas for Course creation and response in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Implement Course Routes**: Add routes for the Course entity in `routers.py`:
   ```python
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @router.get("/courses/{course_id}", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def read_course(course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
       if db_course is None:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Course not found")
       return db_course
   ```

4. **Update Database Migration**: Modify the migration logic in `main.py` to create the Course table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
       # Create the courses table
       Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)
   ```

By implementing these changes, the software will meet the user's requirements and allow for interaction with the Course entity.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the Course entity is fully integrated into the application."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Below is a detailed review based on the regulations provided:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: The Course model and schema are missing. We need to create these and import them in the necessary files.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: There are no methods for handling Course entities (CRUD operations) in the routers.py file.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: The existing methods in routers.py have comments, but we need to add comments for the new Course methods.\n\n4. No potential bugs: The existing code does not contain bugs, but it is incomplete for the Course entity.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The project does not currently conform to the user\'s task as the Course entity is not implemented.\n\n6. User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement: As it stands, the software does not allow interaction with the Course entity.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe highest priority issue is that the Course entity is not implemented at all, which is a critical requirement of the task. \n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Create a Course Model: Add a new model for the Course entity in models.py:\n   python\n   class Course(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Create Course Schemas: Add schemas for Course creation and response in schemas.py:\n   python\n   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       level: str\n\n   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       level: str\n\n       class Config:\n           orm_mode = True\n\n\n3. Implement Course Routes: Add routes for the Course entity in routers.py:\n   python\n   from models import Course\n   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse\n\n   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)\n   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)\n       db.add(db_course)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_course)\n       return db_course\n\n   @router.get("/courses/{course_id}", response_model=CourseResponse)\n   def read_course(course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n       if db_course is None:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Course not found")\n       return db_course\n\n\n4. Update Database Migration*: Modify the migration logic in main.py to create the Course table:\n   python\n   def upgrade():\n       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n       # Create the courses table\n       Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the software will meet the user\'s requirements and allow for interaction with the Course entity.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease implement the suggested changes to ensure the Course entity is fully integrated into the application.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue related to the database migration process that needs to be addressed to ensure that existing Student data is preserved when creating the new Course table.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `upgrade()` function in `main.py` is currently creating the `courses` table without checking for existing data in the `students` table. While the `create_all()` method is called, it does not ensure that existing data is preserved during migrations. Additionally, the `Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)` line is redundant since `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)` already handles the creation of all tables defined in the models.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Remove the Redundant Table Creation**: The line `Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)` should be removed as it is unnecessary.
2. **Ensure Migration Logic**: Although SQLite handles the creation of tables without affecting existing data, it is good practice to ensure that the migration logic is clear and robust. You may want to implement a more structured migration strategy using a library like Alembic for future migrations.

Here’s the revised `upgrade()` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    # No need to create the courses table again as it is already handled by create_all
```

### Final Instructions:
1. Update the `upgrade()` function in `main.py` as suggested above.
2. Test the migration to ensure that existing Student data is preserved and that the Course table is created successfully.

By implementing these changes, the code will conform to the requirements and ensure that the application operates smoothly without losing any existing data.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue related to the database migration process that needs to be addressed to ensure that existing Student data is preserved when creating the new Course table.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `upgrade()` function in `main.py` is currently creating the `courses` table without checking for existing data in the `students` table. While the `create_all()` method is called, it does not ensure that existing data is preserved during migrations. Additionally, the `Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)` line is redundant since `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)` already handles the creation of all tables defined in the models.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Remove the Redundant Table Creation**: The line `Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True)` should be removed as it is unnecessary.
2. **Ensure Migration Logic**: Although SQLite handles the creation of tables without affecting existing data, it is good practice to ensure that the migration logic is clear and robust. You may want to implement a more structured migration strategy using a library like Alembic for future migrations.

Here’s the revised `upgrade()` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    # No need to create the courses table again as it is already handled by create_all
```

### Final Instructions:
1. Update the `upgrade()` function in `main.py` as suggested above.
2. Test the migration to ensure that existing Student data is preserved and that the Course table is created successfully.

By implementing these changes, the code will conform to the requirements and ensure that the application operates smoothly without losing any existing data.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

While the create_all() method is called, it does not ensure that existing data is preserved during migrations. Additionally, the Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True) line is redundant since Base.metadata.create_all(engine) already handles the creation of all tables defined in the models.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Remove the Redundant Table Creation: The line Course.__table__.create(bind=engine, checkfirst=True) should be removed as it is unnecessary.\n2. Ensure Migration Logic*: Although SQLite handles the creation of tables without affecting existing data, it is good practice to ensure that the migration logic is clear and robust. You may want to implement a more structured migration strategy using a library like Alembic for future migrations.\n\nHere’s the revised upgrade() function:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Create all tables if they do not exist\n    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n    # No need to create the courses table again as it is already handled by create_all\n\n\n### Final Instructions:\n1. Update the upgrade() function in main.py as suggested above.\n2. Test the migration to ensure that existing Student data is preserved and that the Course table is created successfully.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will conform to the requirements and ensure that the application operates smoothly without losing any existing data.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!'} |

  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly according to the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic**: The `upgrade` function in `main.py` does not handle the migration of existing data properly. While it creates the new `courses` table, it does not ensure that the existing `students` data is preserved or that the database schema is updated correctly. Additionally, there is no rollback mechanism in place if the migration fails.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `upgrade` function** to ensure that it checks for existing tables and handles migrations appropriately. You may want to use Alembic for more robust migration management, but if you want to keep it simple, you can ensure that the `create_all` method is called only if the tables do not already exist.

2. **Implement a `downgrade` function** that can drop the `courses` table if needed, which is essential for rollback scenarios.

Here’s an updated version of the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    # Check if the courses table already exists
    if not engine.dialect.has_table(engine, 'courses'):
        # Create the courses table if it does not exist
        Course.__table__.create(bind=engine)
```

And the `downgrade` function could look like this:

```python
def downgrade():
    # Drop the courses table if it exists
    if engine.dialect.has_table(engine, 'courses'):
        Course.__table__.drop(bind=engine)
```

### Instructions:
1. Replace the existing `upgrade` function in `main.py` with the updated version provided above.
2. Add the `downgrade` function as shown.
3. Test the migration process to ensure that existing `students` data is preserved and that the `courses` table is created correctly.

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements and functions correctly without losing any existing data.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

# Course Management API

A simple API for managing students and courses.

## Introduction

This API allows users to create and manage students and courses. The main functions include:

- Creating and retrieving student records.
- Creating and retrieving course records.
- The API is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, providing a robust and efficient way to handle data.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy
   ```

4. **Run the database migration to create the necessary tables:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use the API

### Starting the Server

To start the FastAPI server, run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn routers:router --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### API Endpoints

#### Student Endpoints

- **Create a Student**
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /students/`
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```

- **Get a Student by ID**
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /students/{student_id}`
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```

#### Course Endpoints

- **Create a Course**
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /courses/`
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "level": "Beginner"
    }
    ```
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Mathematics",
