To address the customer's task of creating a Teacher entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be to use a **Document** format, which would allow us to provide a detailed description of the Teacher entity, including the fields and requirements. This could be useful for documentation purposes.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Dashboard** format, which would allow us to visualize the Teacher entity alongside existing Student and Course data. This could provide a more interactive experience for the customer.

Another possibility is to create a **Website**, which could serve as a more dynamic platform to present the Teacher entity and allow for future expansions or interactions.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the various product modalities. 

The **Document** format is indeed a solid choice for providing detailed specifications and documentation, which can be beneficial for clarity and future reference. However, it may lack interactivity.

The **Dashboard** format offers a more engaging way to visualize the Teacher entity alongside existing data, which could enhance user experience and provide valuable insights.

The **Website** option presents a flexible platform that could allow for future enhancements and interactions, making it a versatile choice.

Considering the need for both clarity and potential interactivity, I lean towards the **Dashboard** format. It allows us to present the Teacher entity in a way that integrates well with existing data while providing a visual representation.

What do you think? Should we proceed with the Dashboard, or do you have a preference for another modality?

I agree with your assessment of the **Dashboard** format. It strikes a good balance between clarity and interactivity, allowing us to present the Teacher entity in a visually engaging way while also integrating it with existing Student and Course data. This approach can enhance user experience and provide valuable insights at a glance.

Given the customer's requirements and the benefits of the Dashboard format, I believe we should proceed with it. 

Are we in agreement to finalize the Dashboard as our product modality?

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To address the task of creating a Teacher entity and ensuring that the existing codebase is updated accordingly, I will review the provided code against the regulations outlined.

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical oversight as it directly affects the ability to create and manage Teacher entities.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for handling Teacher entities (creation, retrieval, etc.) in the `routers.py` file.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Since there are no methods for the Teacher entity, this point is not applicable.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code does not have any apparent bugs, but without the Teacher entity, it cannot be fully assessed.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not currently conform to the user's task as the Teacher entity is missing.

6. **User interaction with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation does not allow for interaction with Teacher entities, which is a requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the Teacher entity, which is essential to fulfill the user's requirements. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create the Teacher Model**: Add a new model for the Teacher entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create the Teacher Schema**: Add a new schema for the Teacher entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: str

   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Update the Router**: Add routes for creating and retrieving Teacher entities in `routers.py`:
   ```python
   @router.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @router.get("/teachers/{teacher_id}", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def read_teacher(teacher_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = db.query(Teacher).filter(Teacher.id == teacher_id).first()
       if db_teacher is None:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Teacher not found")
       return db_teacher
   ```

4. **Update the Database Migration**: Ensure that the database migration in `main.py` includes the Teacher table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
       # Add the Teacher table creation
       if 'teachers' not in inspector.get_table_names():
           Teacher.__table__.create(bind=engine)
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the user's requirements and allow for the management of Teacher entities alongside existing Student and Course entities.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the Teacher entity is properly integrated into the application.

       email: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Update the Router**: Add routes for creating and retrieving Teacher entities in `routers.py`:
   ```python
   @router.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @router.get("/teachers/{teacher_id}", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def read_teacher(teacher_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = db.query(Teacher).filter(Teacher.id == teacher_id).first()
       if db_teacher is None:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Teacher not found")
       return db_teacher
   ```

4. **Update the Database Migration**: Ensure that the database migration in `main.py` includes the Teacher table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
       # Add the Teacher table creation
       if 'teachers' not in inspector.get_table_names():
           Teacher.__table__.create(bind=engine)
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the user's requirements and allow for the management of Teacher entities alongside existing Student and Course entities.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the Teacher entity is properly integrated into the application.

Comments on Codes:
"To address the task of creating a Teacher entity and ensuring that the existing codebase is updated accordingly, I will review the provided code against the regulations outlined.

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical oversight as it directly affects the ability to create and manage Teacher entities.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for handling Teacher entities (creation, retrieval, etc.) in the `routers.py` file.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Since there are no methods for the Teacher entity, this point is not applicable.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code does not have any apparent bugs, but without the Teacher entity, it cannot be fully assessed.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not currently conform to the user's task as the Teacher entity is missing.

6. **User interaction with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation does not allow for interaction with Teacher entities, which is a requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the Teacher entity, which is essential to fulfill the user's requirements. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create the Teacher Model**: Add a new model for the Teacher entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create the Teacher Schema**: Add a new schema for the Teacher entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: str

   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Update the Router**: Add routes for creating and retrieving Teacher entities in `routers.py`:
   ```python
   @router.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return db_teacher

   @router.get("/teachers/{teacher_id}", response_model=TeacherResponse)
   def read_teacher(teacher_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = db.query(Teacher).filter(Teacher.id == teacher_id).first()
       if db_teacher is None:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Teacher not found")
       return db_teacher
   ```

4. **Update the Database Migration**: Ensure that the database migration in `main.py` includes the Teacher table:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
       # Add the Teacher table creation
       if 'teachers' not in inspector.get_table_names():
           Teacher.__table__.create(bind=engine)
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the user's requirements and allow for the management of Teacher entities alongside existing Student and Course entities.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the suggested changes to ensure the Teacher entity is properly integrated into the application."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the Teacher entity integrated into the application, following the specified format:

All referenced classes should be imported: The Teacher model and schema are not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical oversight as it directly affects the ability to create and manage Teacher entities.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: There are no methods for handling Teacher entities (creation, retrieval, etc.) in the routers.py file.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: Since there are no methods for the Teacher entity, this point is not applicable.\n\n4. No potential bugs: The existing code does not have any apparent bugs, but without the Teacher entity, it cannot be fully assessed.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The project does not currently conform to the user\'s task as the Teacher entity is missing.\n\n6. User interaction with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement: The current implementation does not allow for interaction with Teacher entities, which is a requirement.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the absence of the Teacher entity, which is essential to fulfill the user\'s requirements. \n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Create the Teacher Model: Add a new model for the Teacher entity in models.py:\n   python\n   class Teacher(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'teachers\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Create the Teacher Schema: Add a new schema for the Teacher entity in schemas.py:\n   python\n   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       email: str\n\n   class TeacherResponse(BaseModel):\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       email: str\n\n       class Config:\n           orm_mode = True\n\n\n3. Update the Router: Add routes for creating and retrieving Teacher entities in routers.py:\n   python\n   @router.post("/teachers/", response_model=TeacherResponse)\n   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)\n       db.add(db_teacher)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_teacher)\n       return db_teacher\n\n   @router.get("/teachers/{teacher_id}", response_model=TeacherResponse)\n   def read_teacher(teacher_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_teacher = db.query(Teacher).filter(Teacher.id == teacher_id).first()\n       if db_teacher is None:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Teacher not found")\n       return db_teacher\n\n\n4. Update the Database Migration: Ensure that the database migration in main.py includes the Teacher table:\n   python\n   def upgrade():\n       Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n       # Add the Teacher table creation\n       if \'teachers\' not in inspector.get_table_names():\n           Teacher.__table__.create(bind=engine)\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will meet the user\'s requirements and allow for the management of Teacher entities alongside existing Student and Course entities.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease implement the suggested changes to ensure the Teacher entity is properly integrated into the application.'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the customer's requirements.

**Comment with the Highest Priority:**
The `main.py` file does not handle the preservation of existing `Student` and `Course` data during the migration process. The `upgrade()` function creates the `Teacher` table but does not ensure that existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables remains intact. This could lead to data loss if the migration is run multiple times or if the database schema is altered.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. Modify the `upgrade()` function in `main.py` to ensure that it checks for existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables before creating the `teachers` table. This can be done by querying the existing tables and ensuring that the migration does not interfere with existing data.

2. Ensure that the `downgrade()` function is implemented correctly to drop the `teachers` table without affecting the `students` and `courses` tables.

Here is a suggested revision for the `upgrade()` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Use inspect to check if the student_courses table exists
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    if 'student_courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        student_courses.create(bind=engine)
    
    # Add the Teacher table creation
    if 'teachers' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=engine)
        
    # Ensure that existing Student and Course data is preserved
    # This can be done by checking the count of records in the tables
    if inspector.get_table_names() == ['students', 'courses', 'student_courses']:
        print("Existing Student and Course data is preserved.")
```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process does not disrupt existing data while adding the new `Teacher` entity.

Please make the necessary adjustments to the `main.py` file as suggested above.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the customer's requirements.

**Comment with the Highest Priority:**
The `main.py` file does not handle the preservation of existing `Student` and `Course` data during the migration process. The `upgrade()` function creates the `Teacher` table but does not ensure that existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables remains intact. This could lead to data loss if the migration is run multiple times or if the database schema is altered.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. Modify the `upgrade()` function in `main.py` to ensure that it checks for existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables before creating the `teachers` table. This can be done by querying the existing tables and ensuring that the migration does not interfere with existing data.

2. Ensure that the `downgrade()` function is implemented correctly to drop the `teachers` table without affecting the `students` and `courses` tables.

Here is a suggested revision for the `upgrade()` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Use inspect to check if the student_courses table exists
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    if 'student_courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        student_courses.create(bind=engine)
    
    # Add the Teacher table creation
    if 'teachers' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=engine)
        
    # Ensure that existing Student and Course data is preserved
    # This can be done by checking the count of records in the tables
    if inspector.get_table_names() == ['students', 'courses', 'student_courses']:
        print("Existing Student and Course data is preserved.")
```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the migration process does not disrupt existing data while adding the new `Teacher` entity.

Please make the necessary adjustments to the `main.py` file as suggested above."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

The upgrade() function creates the Teacher table but does not ensure that existing data in the students and courses tables remains intact. This could lead to data loss if the migration is run multiple times or if the database schema is altered.\n\nSuggestions for Revision:\n1. Modify the upgrade() function in main.py to ensure that it checks for existing data in the students and courses tables before creating the teachers table. This can be done by querying the existing tables and ensuring that the migration does not interfere with existing data.\n\n2.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.

Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration logic in `main.py`. The current implementation does not ensure that existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved during the migration process. Specifically, the check for existing tables does not account for the possibility of data loss if the `Teacher` table is created after dropping and recreating the database.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration logic in `main.py` should ensure that the existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved during the creation of the `teachers` table. The current implementation does not adequately handle this, which could lead to data loss.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Backup Existing Data**: Before creating the `teachers` table, you should implement a mechanism to backup the existing `students` and `courses` data. This can be done by querying the data and storing it temporarily.
2. **Create Tables**: After backing up the data, create the `teachers` table.
3. **Restore Data**: After the `teachers` table is created, restore the backed-up data to ensure that no data is lost.

Here’s a revised version of the `upgrade` function in `main.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create all tables if they do not exist
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Backup existing Student and Course data
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    existing_students = []
    existing_courses = []
    
    if 'students' in inspector.get_table_names():
        existing_students = db.execute("SELECT * FROM students").fetchall()
    
    if 'courses' in inspector.get_table_names():
        existing_courses = db.execute("SELECT * FROM courses").fetchall()
    
    # Create Teacher table if it does not exist
    if 'teachers' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        Teacher.__table__.create(bind=engine)
    
    # Restore existing Student and Course data if it was backed up
    if existing_students:
        for student in existing_students:
            db.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", (student.name, student.email))
    
    if existing_courses:
        for course in existing_courses:
            db.execute("INSERT INTO courses (name, level) VALUES (?, ?)", (course.name, course.level))
    
    print("Existing Student and Course data is preserved.")
```

### Instructions:
- Implement the above changes in the `upgrade` function to ensure that existing data is preserved during the migration process.
- Test the migration process thoroughly to confirm that no data is lost and that the `teachers` table is created successfully.

By addressing this issue, you will ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements without risking data integrity.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# ChatDev Teacher Entity Management

Welcome to the ChatDev Teacher Entity Management software! This application allows you to manage Teacher entities, including creating and retrieving teacher records with essential information such as name and email.

## Main Functions

- **Create a Teacher**: Add a new teacher to the database with their name and email.
- **Read a Teacher**: Retrieve the details of a specific teacher by their ID.
- **Database Management**: The application manages the database schema, ensuring that existing Student and Course data is preserved during migrations.

## Installation

To get started, you need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatdev-teacher-management.git
   cd chatdev-teacher-management
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use pip to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi sqlalchemy uvicorn
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**:
   Before starting the application, ensure that the database schema is up to date:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

To start the FastAPI application, run the following command:
```bash
uvicorn routers:router --reload
```
This will start the server, and you can access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
