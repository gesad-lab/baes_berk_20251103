To fulfill the customer's request for creating a Teacher entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information. 

One option is to use a **Document** format, which can clearly outline the entity's structure, including the required fields for name and email. This would be straightforward and easy to understand.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Dashboard** that visualizes the Teacher entity alongside existing Student and Course data, providing a more interactive experience.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I see the value in both options. A **Document** would provide a clear and formal representation of the Teacher entity, which is beneficial for documentation purposes. However, a **Dashboard** could offer a more dynamic view, allowing users to interact with the data and see how the Teacher entity fits into the broader context of the existing Student and Course data.

I lean towards the **Dashboard** option, as it could enhance user engagement and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between entities. What do you think?

I agree that a **Dashboard** would provide a more engaging and interactive experience for users. It allows for real-time visualization of the Teacher entity in relation to existing data, which can be very beneficial for understanding the overall structure and relationships within the system. 

Given the customer's needs and the potential for enhanced user interaction, I think we should proceed with the **Dashboard** option. Shall we finalize this decision?

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a few issues that need to be addressed to meet the customer's requirements and ensure the software operates correctly. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` entity is not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical omission since the task requires creating a `Teacher` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for handling the `Teacher` entity in the `routes.py` file. We need to implement methods for creating and retrieving teachers.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for the `Teacher` entity will need comments as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: The migration script for adding the `email` field to the `students` table is not directly related to the `Teacher` entity but should be reviewed for correctness. The migration should also include the creation of the `Teacher` table.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current implementation does not conform to the task as it lacks the `Teacher` entity and its associated routes.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The lack of a `Teacher` entity and its routes means users cannot interact with the `Teacher` data, which is a significant issue.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the `Teacher` entity and its associated routes in the codebase. This directly violates the customer's requirement to create a `Teacher` entity with `name` and `email` fields.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Teacher Model**: Create a new model for the `Teacher` entity in `models.py` similar to the `Student` model.
   
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Pydantic Model for Teacher**: Add a Pydantic model for creating a teacher in `models.py`.

   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: str
   ```

3. **Add Routes for Teacher**: Implement routes for creating and retrieving teachers in `routes.py`.

   ```python
   @router.post("/teachers/", response_model=dict)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return {"id": db_teacher.id, "name": db_teacher.name, "email": db_teacher.email}

   @router.get("/teachers/", response_model=list)
   def get_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": teacher.id, "name": teacher.name, "email": teacher.email} for teacher in teachers]
   ```

4. **Update Database Migration**: Create a new migration script to add the `Teacher` table while preserving existing data.

   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer's requirements and ensure that the software is operable without further coding.

### Final Note:
Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the project aligns with the task requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a few issues that need to be addressed to meet the customer's requirements and ensure the software operates correctly. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` entity is not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical omission since the task requires creating a `Teacher` entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for handling the `Teacher` entity in the `routes.py` file. We need to implement methods for creating and retrieving teachers.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for the `Teacher` entity will need comments as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: The migration script for adding the `email` field to the `students` table is not directly related to the `Teacher` entity but should be reviewed for correctness. The migration should also include the creation of the `Teacher` table.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current implementation does not conform to the task as it lacks the `Teacher` entity and its associated routes.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The lack of a `Teacher` entity and its routes means users cannot interact with the `Teacher` data, which is a significant issue.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the `Teacher` entity and its associated routes in the codebase. This directly violates the customer's requirement to create a `Teacher` entity with `name` and `email` fields.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Teacher Model**: Create a new model for the `Teacher` entity in `models.py` similar to the `Student` model.
   
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Pydantic Model for Teacher**: Add a Pydantic model for creating a teacher in `models.py`.

   ```python
   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: str
   ```

3. **Add Routes for Teacher**: Implement routes for creating and retrieving teachers in `routes.py`.

   ```python
   @router.post("/teachers/", response_model=dict)
   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return {"id": db_teacher.id, "name": db_teacher.name, "email": db_teacher.email}

   @router.get("/teachers/", response_model=list)
   def get_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": teacher.id, "name": teacher.name, "email": teacher.email} for teacher in teachers]
   ```

4. **Update Database Migration**: Create a new migration script to add the `Teacher` table while preserving existing data.

   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'teachers',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
       )
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer's requirements and ensure that the software is operable without further coding.

### Final Note:
Please proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the project aligns with the task requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: The Teacher entity is not defined or imported in the provided code. This is a critical omission since the task requires creating a Teacher entity.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: There are no methods for handling the Teacher entity in the routes.py file. We need to implement methods for creating and retrieving teachers.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for the Teacher entity will need comments as well.\n\n4. No potential bugs: The migration script for adding the email field to the students table is not directly related to the Teacher entity but should be reviewed for correctness. The migration should also include the creation of the Teacher table.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The current implementation does not conform to the task as it lacks the Teacher entity and its associated routes.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: The lack of a Teacher entity and its routes means users cannot interact with the Teacher data, which is a significant issue.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the absence of the Teacher entity and its associated routes in the codebase. This directly violates the customer\'s requirement to create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Define the Teacher Model: Create a new model for the Teacher entity in models.py similar to the Student model.\n   \n   python\n   class Teacher(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'teachers\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Create Pydantic Model for Teacher: Add a Pydantic model for creating a teacher in models.py.\n\n   python\n   class TeacherCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       email: str\n\n\n3. Add Routes for Teacher: Implement routes for creating and retrieving teachers in routes.py.\n\n   python\n   @router.post("/teachers/", response_model=dict)\n   def create_teacher(teacher: TeacherCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_teacher = Teacher(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)\n       db.add(db_teacher)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_teacher)\n       return {"id": db_teacher.id, "name": db_teacher.name, "email": db_teacher.email}\n\n   @router.get("/teachers/", response_model=list)\n   def get_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       teachers = db.query(Teacher).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()\n       return [{"id": teacher.id, "name": teacher.name, "email": teacher.email} for teacher in teachers]\n\n\n4. Update Database Migration: Create a new migration script to add the Teacher table while preserving existing data.\n\n   python\n   def upgrade():\n       op.create_table(\n           \'teachers\',\n           sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),\n           sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n           sa.Column(\'email\', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n       )\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer\'s requirements and ensure that the software is operable without further coding.\n\n### Final Note:\nPlease proceed with the suggested revisions to ensure the project aligns with the task requirements.'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly according to the user's requirements.

**Comment with the Highest Priority:**
The `email` field for the `Student` entity is being added in the migration script, but it is not included in the `Student` model's definition in `models.py`. This inconsistency can lead to runtime errors when trying to access or manipulate the `email` field for students.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Update the `Student` model in `models.py`:** Ensure that the `email` field is defined as a non-nullable column in the `Student` class. This is already done in the provided code, but make sure it is consistent with the migration script.

2. **Migration Script Consistency:** The migration script should ensure that the `email` field is added to the `students` table without any issues. The current migration script does this correctly, but ensure that the database schema is updated accordingly.

3. **Testing:** After making these changes, run the application and test the API endpoints for both `Student` and `Teacher` to ensure that they work as expected, including the handling of the `email` field.

Here’s a quick check to ensure the `models.py` is consistent:
```python
class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Ensure this is present and matches the migration
```

Make sure to run the migration after making any changes to the model to reflect them in the database.

**Final Instruction:**
After confirming the above points, ensure to test the application thoroughly to verify that all functionalities are intact and that the application behaves as expected.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the task requirements. Here is my highest priority comment:

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The migration script in `migration_script.py` is not correctly preserving existing data as required. Specifically, the addition of the `email` column to the `students` table should not set a default value for existing records, as this could lead to incorrect data being introduced. Instead, the migration should ensure that the existing data is preserved without introducing any default values.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Modify the Migration Script:**
   - Remove the line that sets a default value for the `email` column during the migration. Instead, allow the column to be nullable initially, and then enforce the non-nullable constraint after ensuring that all existing records have valid email values.

Here is the revised `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add email column as nullable initially
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))
    
    # Ensure that all existing records have valid email values before making it non-nullable
    # (This step may require manual intervention to set valid emails for existing records)
    
    # Change the column to be non-nullable after ensuring all records have valid emails
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Create Teacher table
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the application logic for creating and retrieving teachers is thoroughly tested to confirm that it works as expected.
- Consider adding validation for the email format in the `TeacherCreate` Pydantic model to ensure that only valid email addresses are accepted.

By implementing these changes, the code will better align with the requirements and ensure that existing data is preserved correctly during the migration process.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the task requirements. Here is my highest priority comment:

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:**
The migration script in `migration_script.py` is not correctly preserving existing data as required. Specifically, the addition of the `email` column to the `students` table should not set a default value for existing records, as this could lead to incorrect data being introduced. Instead, the migration should ensure that the existing data is preserved without introducing any default values.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Modify the Migration Script:**
   - Remove the line that sets a default value for the `email` column during the migration. Instead, allow the column to be nullable initially, and then enforce the non-nullable constraint after ensuring that all existing records have valid email values.

Here is the revised `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add email column as nullable initially
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))
    
    # Ensure that all existing records have valid email values before making it non-nullable
    # (This step may require manual intervention to set valid emails for existing records)
    
    # Change the column to be non-nullable after ensuring all records have valid emails
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Create Teacher table
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the application logic for creating and retrieving teachers is thoroughly tested to confirm that it works as expected.
- Consider adding validation for the email format in the `TeacherCreate` Pydantic model to ensure that only valid email addresses are accepted.

By implementing these changes, the code will better align with the requirements and ensure that existing data is preserved correctly during the migration process.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries typically used in a FastAPI project with SQLAlchemy, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server used to run the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy, which is used to manage database schema changes.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers based on your project's compatibility and requirements. You can install these dependencies using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the libraries typically used in a FastAPI project with SQLAlchemy, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:
```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server used to run the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy, which is used to manage database schema changes.
Make sure to adjust the version numbers based on your project's compatibility and requirements. You can install these dependencies using the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
