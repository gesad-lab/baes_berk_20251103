To satisfy the new user's demand for a simple web application for a Student entity, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a "Website." This modality allows us to create an interactive web application that can easily handle the API requirements and present JSON responses effectively. 

What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that a "Website" is a suitable product modality for this task. It allows us to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Student entity and can effectively handle the API responses in JSON format. Additionally, it aligns well with the requirements of using FastAPI and SQLite for the backend.

What do you think about finalizing this decision?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup".

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure the application into multiple files. The application will also include a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for user interaction. Below is the outline of the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for this application:

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and the SQLite database.
   - `create_app()`: Initializes the FastAPI application.
   - `create_database()`: Creates the SQLite database and the Student table.

2. **models.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
   - `Student`: A class representing the Student entity with a name field.

3. **database.py**: Handles database connection and session management.
   - `get_db()`: A dependency that provides a database session.

4. **routes.py**: Defines the API endpoints for the Student entity.
   - `create_student()`: Endpoint to create a new student.
   - `get_students()`: Endpoint to retrieve all students.

5. **gui.py**: Implements the GUI using Tkinter for user interaction.
   - `StudentApp`: A class that creates the GUI for adding and displaying students.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code structure is mostly correct, but there are some issues that need to be addressed to ensure that the application functions correctly according to the requirements. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `routes.py`, the `create_student` function is missing a Pydantic model for the request body. The `name` parameter should be part of a request model.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `create_student` method in `routes.py` does not use a Pydantic model for input validation, which is a best practice in FastAPI.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present, but the `create_student` function lacks a description of its parameters and return type.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code does not handle cases where the `name` is empty or invalid. This could lead to an error when trying to add a student.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is good, but the API should return a more structured response.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI code in `gui.py` is functional, but it should handle cases where the user tries to add an empty name.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the lack of input validation for the `name` field in the `create_student` function. This could lead to the application accepting invalid data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Pydantic model for the Student input** in `models.py`:
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel
   
   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
   ```

2. **Update the `create_student` function in `routes.py`** to use this model:
   ```python
   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       if not student.name:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Name is required")
       db_student = Student(name=student.name)
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
   ```

3. **Update the GUI code in `gui.py`** to handle empty names:
   ```python
   def add_student(self):
       name = self.name_entry.get()
       if not name:
           self.output.insert(tk.END, "Name cannot be empty.\n")
           return
       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name})
       ...
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and user-friendly, adhering to the requirements and best practices.

### Final Instruction:
Make the above changes to ensure input validation and improve the overall robustness of the application.

Comments on Codes:
"The code structure is mostly correct, but there are some issues that need to be addressed to ensure that the application functions correctly according to the requirements. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `routes.py`, the `create_student` function is missing a Pydantic model for the request body. The `name` parameter should be part of a request model.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `create_student` method in `routes.py` does not use a Pydantic model for input validation, which is a best practice in FastAPI.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present, but the `create_student` function lacks a description of its parameters and return type.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code does not handle cases where the `name` is empty or invalid. This could lead to an error when trying to add a student.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is good, but the API should return a more structured response.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI code in `gui.py` is functional, but it should handle cases where the user tries to add an empty name.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the lack of input validation for the `name` field in the `create_student` function. This could lead to the application accepting invalid data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Pydantic model for the Student input** in `models.py`:
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel
   
   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
   ```

2. **Update the `create_student` function in `routes.py`** to use this model:
   ```python
   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       if not student.name:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Name is required")
       db_student = Student(name=student.name)
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
   ```

3. **Update the GUI code in `gui.py`** to handle empty names:
   ```python
   def add_student(self):
       name = self.name_entry.get()
       if not name:
           self.output.insert(tk.END, "Name cannot be empty.\n")
           return
       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name})
       ...
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and user-friendly, adhering to the requirements and best practices.

### Final Instruction:
Make the above changes to ensure input validation and improve the overall robustness of the application."

Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - In routes.py, the create_student function is missing a Pydantic model for the request body. The name parameter should be part of a request model.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - The create_student method in routes.py does not use a Pydantic model for input validation, which is a best practice in FastAPI.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - Comments are present, but the create_student function lacks a description of its parameters and return type.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The code does not handle cases where the name is empty or invalid. This could lead to an error when trying to add a student.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The project structure is good, but the API should return a more structured response.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - The GUI code in gui.py is functional, but it should handle cases where the user tries to add an empty name.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the lack of input validation for the name field in the create_student function. This could lead to the application accepting invalid data.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Create a Pydantic model for the Student input in models.py:\n   python\n   from pydantic import BaseModel\n   \n   class StudentCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n\n\n2. Update the create_student function in routes.py to use this model:\n   python\n   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)\n   def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       if not student.name:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Name is required")\n       db_student = Student(name=student.name)\n       db.add(db_student)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_student)\n       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}\n\n\n3. Update the GUI code in gui.py to handle empty names:\n   python\n   def add_student(self):\n       name = self.name_entry.get()\n       if not name:\n           self.output.insert(tk.END, "Name cannot be empty.\\n")\n           return\n       response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name})\n       ...\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and user-friendly, adhering to the requirements and best practices.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nMake the above changes to ensure input validation and improve the overall robustness of the application.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the application operates correctly and efficiently. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `main.py` file is missing the FastAPI application setup and the inclusion of the routes. This is essential for the FastAPI application to function properly and respond to API requests. Without this, the API endpoints defined in `routes.py` will not be accessible.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create the FastAPI application in `main.py`:**
   - Import FastAPI and the router from `routes.py`.
   - Initialize the FastAPI app and include the router.
   - Call the `create_database()` function to ensure the database schema is created on startup.

Here is how you can modify `main.py`:

```python
'''
Implements the FastAPI application for the Student entity.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from routes import router
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    create_database()

# Include the router for student routes
app.include_router(router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that you have `uvicorn` installed to run the FastAPI application.
- The GUI in `gui.py` is separate from the FastAPI application and should be run in a different process or thread if you want to use it simultaneously with the FastAPI server.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable, and users will be able to interact with the API as intended. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The provided code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the application operates correctly and efficiently. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `main.py` file is missing the FastAPI application setup and the inclusion of the routes. This is essential for the FastAPI application to function properly and respond to API requests. Without this, the API endpoints defined in `routes.py` will not be accessible.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create the FastAPI application in `main.py`:**
   - Import FastAPI and the router from `routes.py`.
   - Initialize the FastAPI app and include the router.
   - Call the `create_database()` function to ensure the database schema is created on startup.

Here is how you can modify `main.py`:

```python
'''
Implements the FastAPI application for the Student entity.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from routes import router
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    create_database()

# Include the router for student routes
app.include_router(router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that you have `uvicorn` installed to run the FastAPI application.
- The GUI in `gui.py` is separate from the FastAPI application and should be run in a different process or thread if you want to use it simultaneously with the FastAPI server.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable, and users will be able to interact with the API as intended. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code structure and implementation are mostly in line with the requirements. However, there are a few important issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application operates correctly and adheres to best practices. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `main.py` file is missing the FastAPI application setup and the inclusion of the routes. This is crucial for the application to run as a web server and handle API requests. Without this, the FastAPI application will not be operational.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Add FastAPI Application Setup in `main.py`:** You need to create an instance of the FastAPI application and include the routes defined in `routes.py`. Here’s how you can modify `main.py`:

```python
'''
Implements the FastAPI application for the Student entity.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from routes import router
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    create_database()

# Include the router for handling student-related routes
app.include_router(router)

# Run the application using 'uvicorn main:app --reload' from the terminal
```

### Additional Instructions:
- Ensure you have the FastAPI and Uvicorn installed in your environment. You can install them using:
  ```bash
  pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy
  ```
- To run the application, use the command:
  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
- Make sure to test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or directly from the GUI to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

By implementing these changes, the application will be fully operable and meet the requirements specified by the customer. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The provided code structure and implementation are mostly in line with the requirements. However, there are a few important issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application operates correctly and adheres to best practices. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `main.py` file is missing the FastAPI application setup and the inclusion of the routes. This is crucial for the application to run as a web server and handle API requests. Without this, the FastAPI application will not be operational.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Add FastAPI Application Setup in `main.py`:** You need to create an instance of the FastAPI application and include the routes defined in `routes.py`. Here’s how you can modify `main.py`:

```python
'''
Implements the FastAPI application for the Student entity.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from routes import router
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    create_database()

# Include the router for handling student-related routes
app.include_router(router)

# Run the application using 'uvicorn main:app --reload' from the terminal
```

### Additional Instructions:
- Ensure you have the FastAPI and Uvicorn installed in your environment. You can install them using:
  ```bash
  pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy
  ```
- To run the application, use the command:
  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
- Make sure to test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or directly from the GUI to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

By implementing these changes, the application will be fully operable and meet the requirements specified by the customer. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

### Additional Instructions
- Ensure you have the FastAPI and Uvicorn installed in your environment. You can install them using:
  ```bash
  pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy
  ```
- To run the application, use the command:
  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
- Make sure to test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or directly from the GUI to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

This completes the implementation of the web application for managing students. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found. This typically occurs when the Python installation does not include the Tkinter library, which is often the case in certain environments. To resolve this issue, we can provide instructions for installing the necessary package. However, since the task requires modifying the code, we can also add a check to ensure that the application does not crash if Tkinter is not available.

Here are the modified codes based on the error summary:

**main.py**

### Explanation:
1. **Error Handling**: Added a try-except block around the Tkinter import statement to catch the `ImportError`. If Tkinter is not available, a message is printed to the console, and the program exits gracefully instead of crashing.

This modification ensures that the application can handle the absence of Tkinter more gracefully, providing feedback to the user about the missing dependency. 

If you need further modifications or additional features, please let me know!

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# Student Management Web Application

This is a simple web application designed to manage student records using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite. The application allows users to add students and view the list of students through a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## Main Functions

- **Add Student**: Users can enter a student's name and add it to the database.
- **Show Students**: Users can view the list of all students stored in the database.

## Installation Guide

To set up the environment and run the application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python 3.11+ installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the application code:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd student_app
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the FastAPI Application

Start the FastAPI application by running the `main.py` file:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Step 4: Run the GUI Application

In a separate terminal, run the GUI application:

```bash
python gui.py
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Add a Student**:
   - Open the GUI application.
   - Enter the student's name in the input field.
   - Click the "Add Student" button. If successful, you will see a confirmation message.

2. **Show Students**:
   - Click the "Show Students" button to retrieve and display the list of students. The output will show each student's ID and name.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following API endpoints:

- **POST /students/**: Add a new student.
  - Request Body: `{ "name": "Student Name" }`
  - Response: `{ "id": <student_id>, "name": "Student Name" }`

- **GET /students/**: Retrieve a list of students.
  - Query Parameters: `skip` (optional), `limit` (optional)
  - Response: `[{ "id": <student_id>, "name": "Student Name" }, ...]`

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple interface for managing student records. You can extend its functionality by adding more features such as updating or deleting student records, implementing user authentication, or enhancing the GUI.

For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
