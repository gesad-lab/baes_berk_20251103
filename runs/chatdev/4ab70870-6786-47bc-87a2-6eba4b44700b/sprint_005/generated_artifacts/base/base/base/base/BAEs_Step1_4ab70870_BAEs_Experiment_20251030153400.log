To address the new customer's task of creating a simple web application for a Student entity, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a "Website." This would allow us to create an interactive web interface for users to interact with the Student entity, while also meeting the requirement of returning JSON responses through the FastAPI framework.

What are your thoughts on this modality?

I agree that a "Website" is a suitable product modality for this task. It will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Student entity and effectively utilize the FastAPI framework to handle API requests and responses. Additionally, it aligns well with the requirement for JSON responses. 

Let's hear from others to finalize our decision.

I also support the "Website" modality for this task. It aligns perfectly with the requirements of creating a simple web application using FastAPI, and it will facilitate user interaction with the Student entity while ensuring that we can return JSON responses as needed.

It seems we all agree on this modality.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence

- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure the application into multiple files. The core components of our application will include:

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and sets up the routes.
2. **models.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
3. **database.py**: Handles the database connection and session management.
4. **schemas.py**: Defines the Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.
5. **gui.py**: Implements a simple GUI using Tkinter for user interaction.

### Core Classes and Functions

- **main.py**
  - `create_app()`: Initializes the FastAPI application and sets up routes.
  - `get_students()`: Fetches all students from the database.
  - `create_student()`: Creates a new student in the database.

- **models.py**
  - `Student`: SQLAlchemy model representing the Student entity.

- **database.py**
  - `get_db()`: Provides a database session for each request.

- **schemas.py**
  - `StudentCreate`: Pydantic model for creating a new student.
  - `StudentResponse`: Pydantic model for returning student data.

- **gui.py**
  - `StudentApp`: Class for the Tkinter GUI application.
  - `add_student()`: Function to add a student via the GUI.

Now, let's implement the code for each of these files.

### 1. main.py

```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''

from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])

    return db.query(Student).all()

if __name__ == "__main__":

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = StudentApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
```

### Summary
This implementation provides a complete structure for a simple web application that meets the customer's requirements. The FastAPI application serves as the backend, while the Tkinter GUI allows users to interact with the application visually. The database schema is automatically created on startup, and the API returns JSON responses as required.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code is mostly well-structured, but there are some issues that need to be addressed to ensure it meets the requirements and best practices for a FastAPI web application. Here’s the review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The main FastAPI application and the necessary routes are missing. The FastAPI app should be defined, and the routes for creating and listing students should be implemented.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The FastAPI application lacks the implementation of the API endpoints for creating and retrieving students.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are missing in the FastAPI application code that should describe the purpose of each endpoint.

4. **No potential bugs**: There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the lack of the FastAPI application means that the application won't run as intended.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current code does not fulfill the requirement of creating a FastAPI application with the specified endpoints.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The GUI code is functional, but without the FastAPI application running, the user will not be able to interact with the backend.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the FastAPI application and its endpoints are missing. Without these, the application cannot function as intended.

### Suggested Revision:
You need to create a `main.py` file that initializes the FastAPI application and defines the necessary endpoints for creating and listing students. Below is an example of how to implement this:

```python
# main.py
'''
Main application file for the Student API using FastAPI.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import engine, get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

# Create the FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Create the database tables on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    import models
    models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Instructions:
1. Create a new `main.py` file with the provided code above.
2. Ensure that the FastAPI server is running by executing `uvicorn main:app --reload` in the terminal.
3. Test the application using the GUI to ensure that students can be added and listed correctly.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable and meet all the requirements specified by the customer.

Comments on Codes:
"The provided code is mostly well-structured, but there are some issues that need to be addressed to ensure it meets the requirements and best practices for a FastAPI web application. Here’s the review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The main FastAPI application and the necessary routes are missing. The FastAPI app should be defined, and the routes for creating and listing students should be implemented.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The FastAPI application lacks the implementation of the API endpoints for creating and retrieving students.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are missing in the FastAPI application code that should describe the purpose of each endpoint.

4. **No potential bugs**: There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the lack of the FastAPI application means that the application won't run as intended.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current code does not fulfill the requirement of creating a FastAPI application with the specified endpoints.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The GUI code is functional, but without the FastAPI application running, the user will not be able to interact with the backend.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the FastAPI application and its endpoints are missing. Without these, the application cannot function as intended.

### Suggested Revision:
You need to create a `main.py` file that initializes the FastAPI application and defines the necessary endpoints for creating and listing students. Below is an example of how to implement this:

```python
# main.py
'''
Main application file for the Student API using FastAPI.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import engine, get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

# Create the FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Create the database tables on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    import models
    models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Instructions:
1. Create a new `main.py` file with the provided code above.
2. Ensure that the FastAPI server is running by executing `uvicorn main:app --reload` in the terminal.
3. Test the application using the GUI to ensure that students can be added and listed correctly.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable and meet all the requirements specified by the customer."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

2. Run the FastAPI server by executing:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
3. In a separate terminal, run the GUI application using:
   ```bash
   python main_gui.py
   ```
4. Use the GUI to add and list students, ensuring that the application works as intended.

### Instructions:
1. Ensure you have FastAPI and the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy
   ```
2. Run the FastAPI server by executing:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
3. In a separate terminal, run the GUI application using:
   ```bash
   python main_gui.py
   ```
4. Use the GUI to add and list students, ensuring that the application works as intended.

This revised code fulfills the customer's requirements and follows best practices for structuring a FastAPI web application.

All methods should be implemented: The FastAPI application lacks the implementation of the API endpoints for creating and retrieving students.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: Comments are missing in the FastAPI application code that should describe the purpose of each endpoint.\n\n4. No potential bugs: There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the lack of the FastAPI application means that the application won\'t run as intended.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The current code does not fulfill the requirement of creating a FastAPI application with the specified endpoints.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: The GUI code is functional, but without the FastAPI application running, the user will not be able to interact with the backend.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is that the FastAPI application and its endpoints are missing. Without these, the application cannot function as intended.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\nYou need to create a main.py file that initializes the FastAPI application and defines the necessary endpoints for creating and listing students.

Create a new main.py file with the provided code above.\n2. Ensure that the FastAPI server is running by executing uvicorn main:app --reload in the terminal.\n3. Test the application using the GUI to ensure that students can be added and listed correctly.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will be operable and meet all the requirements specified by the customer.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code is a good start for creating a simple web application for managing students using FastAPI and SQLite. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed to ensure that the application is fully functional and adheres to best practices. 

### Review of Regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The main FastAPI application and the necessary routes are missing. The FastAPI app should be defined, and the routes for creating and listing students should be implemented.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The FastAPI application is not included in the provided code. You need to implement the API endpoints for creating and retrieving students.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - The existing methods in the provided code have some comments, but the FastAPI routes and methods need to be documented as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code does not handle exceptions properly. For instance, if the database connection fails or if there is an issue with the request, appropriate error handling should be implemented.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The FastAPI application is missing, which means the project does not fully conform to the user's requirements.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The user interface (Tkinter) is separate from the FastAPI application. While this is acceptable, it is important to ensure that the FastAPI application is running and accessible for the Tkinter app to function correctly.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the FastAPI application and its routes. Without these, the application cannot fulfill the user's requirements for creating and retrieving student records.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a FastAPI application**: 
   - Add a new file, `main.py`, which initializes the FastAPI app and defines the necessary routes for creating and listing students.

Here is an example of how to implement the FastAPI application:

```python
# main.py
'''
Main application file for the FastAPI Student application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import engine, get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Allow CORS for the frontend application
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Create the database tables
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    # Create the database tables
    import models
    models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Final Instructions:
- Add the above FastAPI application code to a new `main.py` file.
- Ensure that the FastAPI application is running on the specified host and port before using the Tkinter application.
- Test the entire application flow to ensure that the Tkinter interface can successfully interact with the FastAPI backend.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements and function correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"The provided code is a good start for creating a simple web application for managing students using FastAPI and SQLite. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed to ensure that the application is fully functional and adheres to best practices. 

### Review of Regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The main FastAPI application and the necessary routes are missing. The FastAPI app should be defined, and the routes for creating and listing students should be implemented.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The FastAPI application is not included in the provided code. You need to implement the API endpoints for creating and retrieving students.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - The existing methods in the provided code have some comments, but the FastAPI routes and methods need to be documented as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code does not handle exceptions properly. For instance, if the database connection fails or if there is an issue with the request, appropriate error handling should be implemented.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The FastAPI application is missing, which means the project does not fully conform to the user's requirements.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The user interface (Tkinter) is separate from the FastAPI application. While this is acceptable, it is important to ensure that the FastAPI application is running and accessible for the Tkinter app to function correctly.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the FastAPI application and its routes. Without these, the application cannot fulfill the user's requirements for creating and retrieving student records.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a FastAPI application**: 
   - Add a new file, `main.py`, which initializes the FastAPI app and defines the necessary routes for creating and listing students.

Here is an example of how to implement the FastAPI application:

```python
# main.py
'''
Main application file for the FastAPI Student application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import engine, get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Allow CORS for the frontend application
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Create the database tables
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    # Create the database tables
    import models
    models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Final Instructions:
- Add the above FastAPI application code to a new `main.py` file.
- Ensure that the FastAPI application is running on the specified host and port before using the Tkinter application.
- Test the entire application flow to ensure that the Tkinter interface can successfully interact with the FastAPI backend.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements and function correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - The main FastAPI application and the necessary routes are missing. The FastAPI app should be defined, and the routes for creating and listing students should be implemented.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - The FastAPI application is not included in the provided code. You need to implement the API endpoints for creating and retrieving students.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - The existing methods in the provided code have some comments, but the FastAPI routes and methods need to be documented as well.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The existing code does not handle exceptions properly. For instance, if the database connection fails or if there is an issue with the request, appropriate error handling should be implemented.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The FastAPI application is missing, which means the project does not fully conform to the user\'s requirements.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: \n   - The user interface (Tkinter) is separate from the FastAPI application. While this is acceptable, it is important to ensure that the FastAPI application is running and accessible for the Tkinter app to function correctly.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the absence of the FastAPI application and its routes. Without these, the application cannot fulfill the user\'s requirements for creating and retrieving student records.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Create a FastAPI application: \n   - Add a new file, main.py, which initializes the FastAPI app and defines the necessary routes for creating and listing students.\n\nHere is an example of how to implement the FastAPI application:\n\npython\n# main.py\n\'\'\'\nMain application file for the FastAPI Student application.\n\'\'\'\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\nfrom models import Student\nfrom database import engine, get_db\nfrom schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n\n# Initialize FastAPI app\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Allow CORS for the frontend application\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=["*"],\n    allow_credentials=True,\n    allow_methods=["*"],\n    allow_headers=["*"],\n)\n\n# Create the database tables\n@app.on_event("startup")\ndef startup():\n    # Create the database tables\n    import models\n    models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)\n\n@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)\ndef create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    db_student = Student(name=student.name)\n    db.add(db_student)\n    db.commit()\n    db.refresh(db_student)\n    return db_student\n\n@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])\ndef read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()\n    return students\n\n\n### Final Instructions:\n- Add the above FastAPI application code to a new main.py file.\n- Ensure that the FastAPI application is running on the specified host and port before using the Tkinter application.\n- Test the entire application flow to ensure that the Tkinter interface can successfully interact with the FastAPI backend.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the user\'s requirements and function correctly.'} |

- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the overall functionality of the application. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `StudentResponse` schema in `schemas.py` is missing the `Config` class indentation, which will lead to a syntax error. This will prevent the application from running correctly.

### Suggested Revision:
Correct the indentation of the `Config` class within the `StudentResponse` schema. It should be aligned properly to be recognized as part of the `StudentResponse` class.

Here is the corrected `schemas.py`:

```python
'''
Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.
'''
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    '''
    Schema for creating a new student.
    '''
    name: str

class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    '''
    Schema for returning student data.
    '''
    id: int
    name: str

    class Config:  # Corrected indentation
        orm_mode = True
```

### Additional Suggestions:
1. **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling in the `create_student` function to handle cases where the database operation might fail (e.g., duplicate entries).
2. **Validation**: You might want to add validation for the `name` field in the `StudentCreate` schema to ensure it meets certain criteria (e.g., length).
3. **Logging**: Implement logging to capture important events or errors, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring.

By addressing the indentation issue and considering the additional suggestions, the application will be more robust and user-friendly.

If you implement the suggested changes, the application should function correctly.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
