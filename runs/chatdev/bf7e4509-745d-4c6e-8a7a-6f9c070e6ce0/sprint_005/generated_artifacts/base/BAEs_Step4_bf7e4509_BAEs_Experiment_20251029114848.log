To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option is to use a **Dashboard** modality, which could effectively visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time. This would allow users to see which students are enrolled in which courses, and potentially track their progress.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Document** modality, where we could provide a detailed report on the relationship between students and courses, including data tables and descriptions of the relationships.

Another possibility is to use a **Mind Map**, which could visually represent the connections between students and courses, making it easy to understand the relationships at a glance.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you have a preference for one of these modalities, or do you think another option might be more suitable?

I appreciate your insights on the different modalities. 

The **Dashboard** modality stands out to me because it allows for real-time visualization and interaction, which can be very beneficial for users who need to manage and analyze student-course relationships dynamically. It can provide a clear overview and facilitate quick decision-making.

However, the **Document** modality could be useful for providing comprehensive details and context, especially for stakeholders who may prefer a more traditional format for reporting.

The **Mind Map** is an interesting option for visual learners, but it may not provide the depth of information that users might need when dealing with data relationships.

Considering the need for both visualization and detailed data management, I lean towards the **Dashboard** modality as the most effective solution for this task. 

What do you think? Should we proceed with the Dashboard, or do you have any other preferences?

I completely agree with your assessment of the **Dashboard** modality. Its ability to provide real-time visualization and interactivity makes it an excellent choice for managing and analyzing the relationships between students and courses. This approach will not only enhance user experience but also facilitate quick insights and decision-making.

While the Document modality has its merits, the dynamic nature of a Dashboard aligns better with the needs of users who require ongoing management of student-course relationships. 

Given our shared perspective, I believe we have reached a consensus on the Dashboard modality.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a solid foundation, but there are several areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model is imported in `api.py`, but it is not utilized in the `Student` model. We need to establish a relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The methods for creating and retrieving students and courses are implemented, but there are no methods to manage the relationship (e.g., enrolling a student in a course).

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present, but the new methods for managing the relationship will need comments as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code does not have apparent bugs, but the logic for managing relationships is missing.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The task of adding a relationship is not fully implemented. We need to add a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI does not currently support interaction for enrolling students in courses.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The relationship between the Student and Course entities is not established, and there are no methods to manage this relationship.**

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` to establish a many-to-many relationship**:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
   from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

   student_courses = Table(
       'student_courses',
       Base.metadata,
       Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
       Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
   )

   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'students'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
   ```

2. **Add a method in `api.py` to enroll a student in a course**:
   ```python
   @router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}/enroll")
   def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       student = db.query(StudentModel).filter(StudentModel.id == student_id).first()
       course = db.query(CourseModel).filter(CourseModel.id == course_id).first()
       if not student or not course:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
       student.courses.append(course)
       db.commit()
       return {"message": f"Student {student_id} enrolled in Course {course_id}"}
   ```

3. **Update the GUI in `gui.py` to allow users to enroll students in courses**.

4. **Update the migration script to create the `student_courses` association table**:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'student_courses',
           sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
       )
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will fulfill the requirements of the task and allow users to manage the relationship between students and courses effectively. 

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a solid foundation, but there are several areas that need attention to fully meet the requirements of adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Course` model is imported in `api.py`, but it is not utilized in the `Student` model. We need to establish a relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The methods for creating and retrieving students and courses are implemented, but there are no methods to manage the relationship (e.g., enrolling a student in a course).

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present, but the new methods for managing the relationship will need comments as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The existing code does not have apparent bugs, but the logic for managing relationships is missing.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI does not currently support interaction for enrolling students in courses.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The relationship between the Student and Course entities is not established, and there are no methods to manage this relationship.**

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` to establish a many-to-many relationship**:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
   from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

   student_courses = Table(
       'student_courses',
       Base.metadata,
       Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
       Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
   )

   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'students'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
   ```

2. **Add a method in `api.py` to enroll a student in a course**:
   ```python
   @router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}/enroll")
   def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       student = db.query(StudentModel).filter(StudentModel.id == student_id).first()
       course = db.query(CourseModel).filter(CourseModel.id == course_id).first()
       if not student or not course:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
       student.courses.append(course)
       db.commit()
       return {"message": f"Student {student_id} enrolled in Course {course_id}"}
   ```

3. **Update the GUI in `gui.py` to allow users to enroll students in courses**.

4. **Update the migration script to create the `student_courses` association table**:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'student_courses',
           sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
       )
   ```

By implementing these changes, the code will fulfill the requirements of the task and allow users to manage the relationship between students and courses effectively.

We need to establish a relationship between Student and Course.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - The methods for creating and retrieving students and courses are implemented, but there are no methods to manage the relationship (e.g., enrolling a student in a course).\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - Comments are present, but the new methods for managing the relationship will need comments as well.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The existing code does not have apparent bugs, but the logic for managing relationships is missing.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The task of adding a relationship is not fully implemented.

Update the models.py to establish a many-to-many relationship:\n   python\n   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n\n   student_courses = Table(\n       \'student_courses\',\n       Base.metadata,\n       Column(\'student_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n       Column(\'course_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n   )\n\n   class Student(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'students\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")\n\n   class Course(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'courses\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n\n\n2. Add a method in api.py to enroll a student in a course:\n   python\n   @router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}/enroll")\n   def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       student = db.query(StudentModel).filter(StudentModel.id == student_id).first()\n       course = db.query(CourseModel).filter(CourseModel.id == course_id).first()\n       if not student or not course:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")\n       student.courses.append(course)\n       db.commit()\n       return {"message": f"Student {student_id} enrolled in Course {course_id}"}\n\n\n3. Update the GUI in gui.py to allow users to enroll students in courses.\n\n4. Update the migration script to create the student_courses association table:\n   python\n   def upgrade():\n       op.create_table(\n           \'student_courses\',\n           sa.Column(\'student_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n           sa.Column(\'course_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True),\n       )\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will fulfill the requirements of the task and allow users to manage the relationship between students and courses effectively. \n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements of the task, but there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `create_student` and `enroll_student_in_course` methods do not handle the case where a student is already enrolled in a course, which could lead to duplicate enrollments. Additionally, the `create_student` method does not handle the case where a student might be created with an existing email.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Prevent Duplicate Enrollments:**
   In the `enroll_student_in_course` method, check if the student is already enrolled in the course before appending it to the `courses` relationship.

   ```python
   @router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}/enroll")
   def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       student = db.query(StudentModel).filter(StudentModel.id == student_id).first()
       course = db.query(CourseModel).filter(CourseModel.id == course_id).first()
       if not student or not course:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
       if course in student.courses:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Student is already enrolled in this course")
       student.courses.append(course)
       db.commit()
       return {"message": f"Student {student_id} enrolled in Course {course_id}"}
   ```

2. **Handle Existing Email in `create_student`:**
   Before creating a new student, check if a student with the same email already exists.

   ```python
   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
   def create_student(student: Student, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       existing_student = db.query(StudentModel).filter(StudentModel.email == student.email).first()
       if existing_student:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Email already registered")
       db_student = StudentModel(name=student.name, email=student.email)
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name, "email": db_student.email}
   ```

### Summary:
By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the application prevents duplicate enrollments and handles existing emails appropriately, thus enhancing the robustness of the code and aligning with the requirements.

If you make these adjustments, the code will be more reliable and user-friendly.

       db_student = StudentModel(name=student.name, email=student.email)
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a course relationship to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `create_student` and `get_students` methods in `api.py` do not handle the relationship between students and courses. While the `enroll_student_in_course` method allows for enrolling students in courses, there is no mechanism to create or retrieve students with their associated courses in the responses. This could lead to confusion for users who expect to see the courses associated with each student.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Update the `Student` Pydantic model** to include a list of course IDs to reflect the relationship:
   ```python
   class Student(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: EmailStr
       course_ids: list[int] = []  # Add this line to include course IDs
   ```

2. **Modify the `create_student` method** to handle course enrollment upon creation:
   ```python
   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
   def create_student(student: Student, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = StudentModel(name=student.name, email=student.email)
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       
       # Enroll in courses if provided
       for course_id in student.course_ids:
           course = db.query(CourseModel).filter(CourseModel.id == course_id).first()
           if course:
               db_student.courses.append(course)
       
       db.commit()
       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name, "email": db_student.email, "course_ids": student.course_ids}
   ```

3. **Update the `get_students` method** to include the courses associated with each student:
   ```python
   @router.get("/students/", response_model=list)
   def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       students = db.query(StudentModel).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [
           {
               "id": student.id,
               "name": student.name,
               "email": student.email,
               "course_ids": [course.id for course in student.courses]  # Include course IDs
           } for student in students
       ]
   ```

By implementing these changes, the API will now correctly reflect the relationship between students and courses, allowing users to create students with associated courses and retrieve that information when querying students.

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the software meets the user's requirements effectively.

However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. \n\nHighest Priority Comment:\nThe create_student and get_students methods in api.py do not handle the relationship between students and courses. While the enroll_student_in_course method allows for enrolling students in courses, there is no mechanism to create or retrieve students with their associated courses in the responses. This could lead to confusion for users who expect to see the courses associated with each student.\n\nSuggestions for Revision:\n1. Update the Student Pydantic model to include a list of course IDs to reflect the relationship:\n   python\n   class Student(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       email: EmailStr\n       course_ids: list[int] = []  # Add this line to include course IDs\n\n\n2. Modify the create_student method to handle course enrollment upon creation:\n   python\n   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)\n   def create_student(student: Student, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_student = StudentModel(name=student.name, email=student.email)\n       db.add(db_student)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_student)\n       \n       # Enroll in courses if provided\n       for course_id in student.course_ids:\n           course = db.query(CourseModel).filter(CourseModel.id == course_id).first()\n           if course:\n               db_student.courses.append(course)\n       \n       db.commit()\n       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name, "email": db_student.email, "course_ids": student.course_ids}\n\n\n3. Update the get_students method to include the courses associated with each student:\n   python\n   @router.get("/students/", response_model=list)\n   def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       students = db.query(StudentModel).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()\n       return [\n           {\n               "id": student.id,\n               "name": student.name,\n               "email": student.email,\n               "course_ids": [course.id for course in student.courses]  # Include course IDs\n           } for student in students\n       ]\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the API will now correctly reflect the relationship between students and courses, allowing users to create students with associated courses and retrieve that information when querying students.\n\nPlease proceed with these revisions to ensure the software meets the user\'s requirements effectively.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally meets the requirements for adding a course relationship to the Student entity. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

**Highest Priority Comment:**
The `create_student` and `get_students` methods in `api.py` do not handle the relationship between students and courses. While the `enroll_student_in_course` method allows for enrolling students in courses, there is no mechanism to create or retrieve students with their associated courses in the responses. This could lead to confusion for users who expect to see the courses associated with each student.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Update the `Student` Pydantic model** to include a list of course IDs to reflect the relationship:
   ```python
   class Student(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: EmailStr
       course_ids: list[int] = []  # Add this line to include course IDs
   ```

2. **Modify the `create_student` method** to handle course enrollment upon creation:
   ```python
   @router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
   def create_student(student: Student, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_student = StudentModel(name=student.name, email=student.email)
       db.add(db_student)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_student)
       
       # Enroll in courses if provided
       for course_id in student.course_ids:
           course = db.query(CourseModel).filter(CourseModel.id == course_id).first()
           if course:
               db_student.courses.append(course)
       
       db.commit()
       return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name, "email": db_student.email, "course_ids": student.course_ids}
   ```

3. **Update the `get_students` method** to include the courses associated with each student:
   ```python
   @router.get("/students/", response_model=list)
   def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       students = db.query(StudentModel).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [
           {
               "id": student.id,
               "name": student.name,
               "email": student.email,
               "course_ids": [course.id for course in student.courses]  # Include course IDs
           } for student in students
       ]
   ```

By implementing these changes, the API will now correctly reflect the relationship between students and courses, allowing users to create students with associated courses and retrieve that information when querying students.

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the software meets the user's requirements effectively."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

## Main Functions

The Student and Course Management System provides the following functionalities:

- **Student Management**: Create, retrieve, and manage student records.
- **Course Management**: Create, retrieve, and manage course records.
- **Enrollment**: Enroll students in courses and manage their course relationships.
- **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in a SQLite database, ensuring data integrity and persistence.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-course-management.git
   cd student-course-management
   ```
