To satisfy the new customer's task of creating a Course entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. Given the requirements, I believe a database schema update is essential, but we also need to think about how the Course entity will be utilized or displayed to the end-users.

1. **Dashboard**: This could be a good option if we want to visualize the Course data in real-time, allowing users to see various metrics related to courses, such as the number of courses, levels, and perhaps even student enrollments.

2. **Document**: A document could be useful for providing detailed descriptions of the Course entity, including its fields and how it integrates with existing data. However, it may not be the most interactive option.

3. **Website**: A website could serve as a platform to display the Course entity, allowing users to interact with the data, perhaps even enabling them to create or manage courses directly.

4. **Application**: If we want to create a more interactive experience, an application could allow users to manage courses dynamically, but it may require more development resources.

5. **Mind Map**: This could be useful for brainstorming or visualizing the relationships between different courses and their levels, but it may not be the most practical for presenting the Course entity itself.

Given these options, I think a **Dashboard** or a **Website** would be the most effective modalities for presenting the Course entity. What are your thoughts?

I appreciate your insights on the various modalities. Here are my thoughts on the options you've presented:

1. **Dashboard**: I agree that a dashboard could provide real-time insights and metrics related to the Course entity. It would allow users to visualize data trends and make informed decisions based on the information presented.

2. **Document**: While a document can provide detailed information, it lacks interactivity and may not engage users as effectively as other options.

3. **Website**: A website would allow for a more interactive experience, enabling users to view, create, and manage courses. This could be a strong choice as it combines presentation and functionality.

4. **Application**: Although an application could provide a dynamic experience, it may require more resources and time to develop, which could delay our response to the customer's needs.

5. **Mind Map**: This option is more suited for brainstorming and may not effectively present the Course entity to end-users.

Considering the need for both presentation and interactivity, I lean towards the **Website** as the best option. It allows us to showcase the Course entity effectively while providing users with the ability to interact with the data. 

What do you think? Should we finalize on the Website?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has several areas that need attention to fulfill the customer's requirements for creating a Course entity and ensuring the database migration preserves existing Student data. Below is the review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Course` model is not defined or imported in the provided code. This is necessary to create the Course entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There is no method implemented for creating or managing the Course entity.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are missing for the new Course-related methods that need to be added.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code does not have bugs, but it lacks the implementation for the Course entity.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current implementation does not conform to the user's task as the Course entity is not created.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation does not allow interaction with the Course entity.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the Course entity and its corresponding database migration. This is essential to meet the customer's requirement.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Course Model**: Create a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a Migration Script**: Add a migration script to create the Course table:
   ```python
   # migration_script.py
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer
   from alembic import op

   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'courses',
           Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
           Column('name', String, nullable=False),
           Column('level', String, nullable=False)
       )

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_table('courses')
   ```

3. **Implement Course API Routes**: Create a new API route for managing courses in a new file `course.py`:
   ```python
   from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
   from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
   from database import SessionLocal
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

   router = APIRouter()

   @router.post("/courses", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course
   ```

4. **Update the Main Application**: Include the course router in `main.py`:
   ```python
   from course import router as course_router  # Ensure this import is present
   app.include_router(course_router)
   ```

5. **Create Pydantic Schemas**: Define the Pydantic schemas for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating a Course entity and preserving existing Student data during migration.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the above suggestions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's requirements.

   ```

2. **Create a Migration Script**: Add a migration script to create the Course table:
   ```python
   # migration_script.py
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer
   from alembic import op

   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'courses',

           Column('name', String, nullable=False),
           Column('level', String, nullable=False)
       )

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_table('courses')
   ```

3. **Implement Course API Routes**: Create a new API route for managing courses in a new file `course.py`:

       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course
   ```

4. **Update the Main Application**: Include the course router in `main.py`:
   ```python
   from course import router as course_router  # Ensure this import is present
   app.include_router(course_router)
   ```

   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has several areas that need attention to fulfill the customer's requirements for creating a Course entity and ensuring the database migration preserves existing Student data. Below is the review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Course` model is not defined or imported in the provided code. This is necessary to create the Course entity.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There is no method implemented for creating or managing the Course entity.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are missing for the new Course-related methods that need to be added.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code does not have bugs, but it lacks the implementation for the Course entity.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current implementation does not conform to the user's task as the Course entity is not created.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current implementation does not allow interaction with the Course entity.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the Course entity and its corresponding database migration. This is essential to meet the customer's requirement.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Course Model**: Create a new model for the Course entity in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a Migration Script**: Add a migration script to create the Course table:
   ```python
   # migration_script.py
   from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer
   from alembic import op

   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'courses',
           Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
           Column('name', String, nullable=False),
           Column('level', String, nullable=False)
       )

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_table('courses')
   ```

3. **Implement Course API Routes**: Create a new API route for managing courses in a new file `course.py`:
   ```python
   from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
   from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
   from database import SessionLocal
   from models import Course
   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse

   router = APIRouter()

   @router.post("/courses", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course
   ```

4. **Update the Main Application**: Include the course router in `main.py`:
   ```python
   from course import router as course_router  # Ensure this import is present
   app.include_router(course_router)
   ```

5. **Create Pydantic Schemas**: Define the Pydantic schemas for the Course entity in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements for creating a Course entity and preserving existing Student data during migration.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the above suggestions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer's requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

This is necessary to create the Course entity.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: There is no method implemented for creating or managing the Course entity.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: Comments are missing for the new Course-related methods that need to be added.\n\n4. No potential bugs: The existing code does not have bugs, but it lacks the implementation for the Course entity.\n\n5.

Implement Course API Routes: Create a new API route for managing courses in a new file course.py:\n   python\n   from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import Session\n   from database import SessionLocal\n   from models import Course\n   from schemas import CourseCreate, CourseResponse\n\n   router = APIRouter()\n\n   @router.post("/courses", response_model=CourseResponse)\n   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)\n       db.add(db_course)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_course)\n       return db_course\n\n\n4. Update the Main Application: Include the course router in main.py:\n   python\n   from course import router as course_router  # Ensure this import is present\n   app.include_router(course_router)\n\n\n5. Create Pydantic Schemas: Define the Pydantic schemas for the Course entity in schemas.py:\n   python\n   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       level: str\n\n   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):\n       id: int\n       name: str\n       level: str\n\n       class Config:\n           orm_mode = True\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer\'s requirements for creating a Course entity and preserving existing Student data during migration.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease implement the above suggestions to ensure the application is fully functional and meets the customer\'s requirements.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:

  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the task requirements. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `migration_script.py` file should ensure that the email column in the `students` table is added as non-nullable after the initial migration to preserve existing data. This is crucial to prevent any issues with existing records that do not have an email value.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `migration_script.py`** to first add the email column as nullable, then populate it with default values (if necessary), and finally alter the column to be non-nullable. Here’s how you can modify the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Step 1: Add the email column as nullable
    op.add_column('students', Column('email', String, nullable=True))
    
    # Step 2: (Optional) Populate existing records with a default value or leave as is
    # This step would require a separate SQL command to update existing records if needed.
    
    # Step 3: Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Create the Course table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
        Column('name', String, nullable=False),
        Column('level', String, nullable=False)
    )
```

2. **Ensure that the database migration is run after making these changes** to reflect the updates in the database schema.

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the API endpoints for courses are tested to confirm that they work as expected.
- Consider adding validation for the `level` field in the `CourseCreate` schema to ensure it meets any specific requirements (e.g., predefined levels).

By implementing these changes, the code will better align with the requirements and ensure that existing student data is preserved correctly during the migration process.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the task requirements. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `migration_script.py` file should ensure that the email column in the `students` table is added as non-nullable after the initial migration to preserve existing data. This is crucial to prevent any issues with existing records that do not have an email value.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `migration_script.py`** to first add the email column as nullable, then populate it with default values (if necessary), and finally alter the column to be non-nullable. Here’s how you can modify the `upgrade` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Step 1: Add the email column as nullable
    op.add_column('students', Column('email', String, nullable=True))
    
    # Step 2: (Optional) Populate existing records with a default value or leave as is
    # This step would require a separate SQL command to update existing records if needed.
    
    # Step 3: Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Create the Course table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
        Column('name', String, nullable=False),
        Column('level', String, nullable=False)
    )
```

2. **Ensure that the database migration is run after making these changes** to reflect the updates in the database schema.

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the API endpoints for courses are tested to confirm that they work as expected.
- Consider adding validation for the `level` field in the `CourseCreate` schema to ensure it meets any specific requirements (e.g., predefined levels).

By implementing these changes, the code will better align with the requirements and ensure that existing student data is preserved correctly during the migration process.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"

Update the migration_script.py to first add the email column as nullable, then populate it with default values (if necessary), and finally alter the column to be non-nullable. Here’s how you can modify the upgrade function:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Step 1: Add the email column as nullable\n    op.add_column('students', Column('email', String, nullable=True))\n    \n    # Step 2: (Optional) Populate existing records with a default value or leave as is\n    # This step would require a separate SQL command to update existing records if needed.\n    \n    # Step 3: Alter the email column to be non-nullable\n    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)\n    \n    # Create the Course table\n    op.create_table(\n        'courses',\n        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),\n        Column('name', String, nullable=False),\n        Column('level', String, nullable=False)\n    )\n\n\n2. Ensure that the database migration is run after making these changes to reflect the updates in the database schema.\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- Ensure that the API endpoints for courses are tested to confirm that they work as expected.\n- Consider adding validation for the level field in the CourseCreate schema to ensure it meets any specific requirements (e.g., predefined levels).\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will better align with the requirements and ensure that existing student data is preserved correctly during the migration process.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue related to the database migration script and the handling of the email field in the Student model. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script for adding the email field to the Student entity is not correctly preserving existing Student data. The email column is initially set to nullable, which could lead to data integrity issues if existing records are not updated with a default value before altering the column to be non-nullable.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the Migration Script**: Modify the migration script to ensure that existing records are updated with a default email value before making the column non-nullable. This can be done by adding a SQL command to populate the email field for existing records.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Step 1: Add the email column as nullable
    op.add_column('students', Column('email', String, nullable=True))
    
    # Step 2: Populate existing records with a default value (e.g., 'noemail@example.com')
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = 'noemail@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL")
    
    # Step 3: Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Create the Course table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
        Column('name', String, nullable=False),
        Column('level', String, nullable=False)
    )
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that the default email value is appropriate for your application context. You may want to consider a more meaningful default or handle it differently based on your requirements.
- After implementing the migration, test the application to confirm that existing Student records are preserved correctly and that the new Course entity functions as expected.

By addressing this issue, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements without losing any existing data integrity. 

If you implement the above suggestions, the code should function correctly without any issues.

    # Step 3: Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Create the Course table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
        Column('name', String, nullable=False),
        Column('level', String, nullable=False)
    )
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that the default email value is appropriate for your application context. You may want to consider a more meaningful default or handle it differently based on your requirements.
- After implementing the migration, test the application to confirm that existing Student records are preserved correctly and that the new Course entity functions as expected.

By addressing this issue, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements without losing any existing data integrity. 

If you implement the above suggestions, the code should function correctly without any issues.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
alembic==1.10.3
pydantic==1.10.7
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Note: Tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to specify in requirements
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **alembic**: The migration tool for managing database schema changes.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization.
- **requests**: Used for making HTTP requests in the GUI.
- **tkinter**: The GUI toolkit is included with Python, so it doesn't need to be specified in the `requirements.txt`.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project's needs or the latest stable versions available at the time of installation.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

# Course Management System

A simple application for managing students and courses.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install fastapi sqlalchemy alembic requests
```

Additionally, you may need to install a database driver if you are using a different database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).

## 🤔 What is this?

The Course Management System allows users to manage student and course data through a simple API. The main functionalities include:

- **Student Registration**: Add new students with their names and email addresses.
- **Course Creation**: Create new courses with a name and level.
- **Database Management**: The application uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and Alembic for database migrations.

## 📖 Main Functions

### 1. Student Registration

You can register a new student by providing their name and email address. The application will store this information in the database.

**API Endpoint**: `POST /students`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### 2. Course Creation

You can create a new course by providing its name and level. This information will be stored in the database.

**API Endpoint**: `POST /courses`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "name": "Introduction to Programming",
  "level": "Beginner"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Introduction to Programming",
  "level": "Beginner"
}
```

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Start the FastAPI application by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Access the GUI**: You can use the provided `gui.py` script to interact with the API through a simple graphical user interface. Run it with:

   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

3. **Use API Endpoints**: You can also interact with the API directly using tools like Postman or curl. 

   - To register a student, send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/students` with the appropriate JSON body.
   - To create a course, send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses` with the course details.
