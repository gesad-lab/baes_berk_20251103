To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we should consider the best product modality that can effectively present and manage this information. 

Given the nature of the Course entity, which includes structured data (name and level), I believe a Database or Application modality could be suitable. However, we need to ensure that the product can not only store this data but also allow for easy interaction and visualization.

What are your thoughts on using a Dashboard to visualize the Course data, or perhaps an Application that could manage and display the Courses effectively?

I agree that a Dashboard could be an excellent choice for visualizing the Course data, as it would allow users to see the information in a clear and interactive manner. It can present the Courses in a way that highlights their names and levels, and potentially allow for filtering or sorting based on these attributes.

On the other hand, an Application could provide more functionality, such as adding, editing, or deleting Courses, along with visualizing the data. This could be particularly useful if the customer needs to manage the Courses actively.

Ultimately, I think we should weigh the importance of visualization versus management capabilities. What do you think about prioritizing the Dashboard for visualization while also considering the Application for management?

I see the merit in prioritizing the Dashboard for visualization, as it would provide a user-friendly interface to present the Courses clearly. This could enhance user engagement and understanding of the data.

However, I also agree that having an Application could significantly enhance the overall functionality by allowing users to manage the Courses directly. This dual approach could cater to both visualization and management needs, making the product more versatile.

Perhaps we could consider starting with the Dashboard for visualization and then explore the possibility of developing an Application later for management purposes. This way, we can deliver a product that meets immediate needs while keeping future enhancements in mind. 

What do you think about this approach? Shall we finalize on the Dashboard as our primary product modality?

I think your approach makes a lot of sense. Starting with the Dashboard for visualization allows us to deliver a product that meets the customer's immediate needs effectively. It provides a clear and engaging way to present the Course data, which is crucial for user interaction.

Additionally, keeping the option open for developing an Application later for management purposes is a smart strategy. It allows us to enhance the product based on user feedback and evolving requirements without overwhelming the initial development process.

Let's finalize on the Dashboard as our primary product modality.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity and ensuring the existing Student data is preserved, I will review the provided code against the regulations outlined. 

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The necessary imports for the Course entity are missing in the `routes.py`, `models.py`, and `schemas.py` files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The methods for handling Course creation and retrieval are not implemented.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are missing for the new methods that need to be added.

4. **No potential bugs**: Since the Course entity is not implemented, potential bugs related to its functionality exist.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The current implementation does not conform to the user's request as it lacks the Course entity.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The GUI and API do not allow for interaction with the Course entity.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the Course entity is not implemented in the codebase, which directly violates the customer's requirement. The application currently only manages Student data and does not include any functionality for Course management.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course Model**:
   In `models.py`, define a new `Course` class:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
   from database import Base

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create a Course Schema**:
   In `schemas.py`, define a Pydantic model for the Course entity:
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel

   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str
   ```

3. **Implement Course Routes**:
   In `routes.py`, add routes for creating and retrieving courses:
   ```python
   from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
   from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
   from models import Course
   from database import get_db
   from schemas import CourseCreate

   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=dict)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       if not course.name:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Name is required")
       if not course.level:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Level is required")
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return {"id": db_course.id, "name": db_course.name, "level": db_course.level}

   @router.get("/courses/", response_model=list)
   def get_courses(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       courses = db.query(Course).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": course.id, "name": course.name, "level": course.level} for course in courses]
   ```

4. **Update Database Migration**:
   Ensure that the database migration includes the new Course table while preserving existing Student data. This can be done by calling `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` after defining the Course model.

5. **Update GUI**:
   Extend the GUI in `gui.py` to allow users to add and view courses similarly to how students are managed.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements and allow for interaction with both Student and Course entities.

### Final Note:
Please implement the above suggestions to ensure the application meets the customer's needs.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's request for creating a Course entity with the specified fields and updating the database schema while preserving existing Student data, I will modify the existing codebase accordingly. Below are the updated files following the specified format:

[2025-29-10 20:29:50 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To fulfill the customer's request for creating a Course entity with the specified fields and updating the database schema while preserving existing Student data, I will modify the existing codebase accordingly. Below are the updated files following the specified format:

### models.py
```python
'''
Defines the SQLAlchemy models for the application, including Student and Course entities.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from database import Base

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

### schemas.py
```python
'''
Defines the Pydantic models for request validation of the Student and Course entities.

    name: str
    email: str

class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str
```

### routes.py

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration and Schema Creation**: The `create_database` function in `database.py` does not currently handle the migration of the existing database schema to include the new `Course` table without losing the existing `Student` data. The `create_all` method will create tables only if they do not exist, but it does not handle migrations. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement a Migration Strategy**: Use a migration tool like Alembic to manage database schema changes. This will allow you to create migration scripts that can be applied to the existing database without losing any data. 

2. **Modify `create_database`**: If you choose not to use Alembic, you should implement a check to see if the `courses` table exists before attempting to create it. This can be done using SQLAlchemy's `inspect` module.

Here’s a basic example of how you could modify the `create_database` function to check for the existence of the `courses` table:

```python
from sqlalchemy import inspect

def create_database():
    inspector = inspect(engine)
    if 'courses' not in inspector.get_table_names():
        Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the application is tested thoroughly after implementing the migration strategy to confirm that existing `Student` data remains intact and that the new `Course` functionality works as expected.

By addressing the migration strategy, you will ensure that the application meets the requirement of preserving existing `Student` data while adding the new `Course` entity.

If you implement these changes, the code will be more robust and compliant with the user's requirements.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes according to the requirements and comments provided. Each file is formatted as specified.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have assessed it against the regulations outlined. Here are my findings:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: All necessary classes are imported correctly in the `routes.py`, `schemas.py`, and `models.py` files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: All methods in the code are implemented as required.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: While there are some comments present, they could be improved for clarity and completeness. For example, the methods in `routes.py` could benefit from more detailed comments explaining their purpose and parameters.

4. **No potential bugs**: The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, error handling could be improved in the `add_course` and `show_courses` methods to handle unexpected responses more gracefully.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project meets the requirements set forth by the user, including the creation of the `Course` entity and the necessary API routes.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The GUI allows for user interaction with both students and courses, fulfilling the requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the lack of database migration handling to ensure that existing `Student` data is preserved when adding the new `Course` table. While the current implementation creates the tables, it does not account for migrations, which could lead to data loss or inconsistencies in a production environment.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement Database Migration**: Use a migration tool like Alembic to handle schema changes. This will allow you to create migration scripts that can be run to update the database schema without losing existing data.

2. **Update `create_database` Function**: Modify the `create_database` function in `database.py` to check if the `Course` table already exists before creating it. This can help prevent issues during development.

3. **Add Comments**: Enhance the comments in the `routes.py` file to provide more context about the purpose of each method and the expected input/output.

### Example of Migration Implementation:
You can set up Alembic by following these steps:
- Install Alembic: `pip install alembic`
- Initialize Alembic in your project directory: `alembic init alembic`
- Configure `alembic.ini` with your database URL.
- Create a migration script: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add Course table"`
- Run the migration: `alembic upgrade head`

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that your application can handle database schema changes more robustly while preserving existing data.

If you need further assistance with the migration setup or any other aspect, feel free to ask!

Here are my findings:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: All necessary classes are imported correctly in the routes.py, schemas.py, and models.py files.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: All methods in the code are implemented as required.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: While there are some comments present, they could be improved for clarity and completeness. For example, the methods in routes.py could benefit from more detailed comments explaining their purpose and parameters.\n\n4. No potential bugs: The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, error handling could be improved in the add_course and show_courses methods to handle unexpected responses more gracefully.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The project meets the requirements set forth by the user, including the creation of the Course entity and the necessary API routes.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: The GUI allows for user interaction with both students and courses, fulfilling the requirements.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the lack of database migration handling to ensure that existing Student data is preserved when adding the new Course table. While the current implementation creates the tables, it does not account for migrations, which could lead to data loss or inconsistencies in a production environment.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Implement Database Migration: Use a migration tool like Alembic to handle schema changes. This will allow you to create migration scripts that can be run to update the database schema without losing existing data.\n\n2. Update create_database Function: Modify the create_database function in database.py to check if the Course table already exists before creating it. This can help prevent issues during development.\n\n3. Add Comments*: Enhance the comments in the routes.py file to provide more context about the purpose of each method and the expected input/output.\n\n### Example of Migration Implementation:\nYou can set up Alembic by following these steps:\n- Install Alembic: pip install alembic\n- Initialize Alembic in your project directory: alembic init alembic\n- Configure alembic.ini with your database URL.\n- Create a migration script: alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add Course table"\n- Run the migration: alembic upgrade head\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that your application can handle database schema changes more robustly while preserving existing data.\n\nIf you need further assistance with the migration setup or any other aspect, feel free to ask!'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have assessed it against the regulations outlined. Here are my findings:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: All necessary classes are imported correctly in the `routes.py`, `schemas.py`, and `models.py` files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: All methods in the code are implemented as required.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: While there are some comments present, they could be improved for clarity and completeness. For example, the methods in `routes.py` could benefit from more detailed comments explaining their purpose and parameters.

4. **No potential bugs**: The code appears to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs. However, error handling could be improved in the `add_course` and `show_courses` methods to handle unexpected responses more gracefully.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project meets the requirements set forth by the user, including the creation of the `Course` entity and the necessary API routes.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The GUI allows for user interaction with both students and courses, fulfilling the requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the lack of database migration handling to ensure that existing `Student` data is preserved when adding the new `Course` table. While the current implementation creates the tables, it does not account for migrations, which could lead to data loss or inconsistencies in a production environment.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement Database Migration**: Use a migration tool like Alembic to handle schema changes. This will allow you to create migration scripts that can be run to update the database schema without losing existing data.

2. **Update `create_database` Function**: Modify the `create_database` function in `database.py` to check if the `Course` table already exists before creating it. This can help prevent issues during development.

3. **Add Comments**: Enhance the comments in the `routes.py` file to provide more context about the purpose of each method and the expected input/output.

### Example of Migration Implementation:
You can set up Alembic by following these steps:
- Install Alembic: `pip install alembic`
- Initialize Alembic in your project directory: `alembic init alembic`
- Configure `alembic.ini` with your database URL.
- Create a migration script: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add Course table"`
- Run the migration: `alembic upgrade head`

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that your application can handle database schema changes more robustly while preserving existing data.

If you need further assistance with the migration setup or any other aspect, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

### Alembic Migration Setup
To implement database migration, follow these steps:

1. Install Alembic:
   ```bash
   pip install alembic
   ```

2. Initialize Alembic in your project directory:
   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   ```

3. Configure `alembic.ini` with your database URL.

4. Create a migration script:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add Course table"
   ```

5. Run the migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

By following these steps and implementing the changes, the application will be more robust, and existing data will be preserved during schema changes. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your FastAPI application, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for the project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
requests==2.28.1
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: The ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.
- **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to interact with the API.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers if you want to use different versions or if there are newer versions available. You can create this file in the root directory of your project.

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
