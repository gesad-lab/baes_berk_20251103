To meet the customer's requirements for a simple web application that handles a Student entity, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a "Website." This modality allows us to create an interactive web application using FastAPI, which can effectively handle API requests and return JSON responses as specified. Additionally, it aligns well with the need for a user-friendly interface to manage student data.

What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that a "Website" is a fitting product modality for this task. It allows us to leverage FastAPI's capabilities to create a RESTful API while providing a straightforward way for users to interact with the Student entity. This approach will also facilitate easy integration with the SQLite database for data persistence. 

Let's proceed with this modality. Any further opinions?

I concur with the decision to go with a "Website" as the product modality. It not only meets the customer's requirements effectively but also allows for scalability and future enhancements if needed. The use of FastAPI will enable us to create a robust API, and the web interface will provide a seamless user experience for managing student data.

If there are no further opinions, we can finalize our decision.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using FastAPI and SQLite, we will structure the application into multiple files. The core components of the application will include:

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and sets up the routes.
2. **models.py**: Defines the database model for the Student entity.
3. **database.py**: Handles the database connection and session management.
4. **schemas.py**: Defines the Pydantic schemas for request and response validation.
5. **gui.py**: Implements a simple GUI using Tkinter to interact with the API.

### Core Classes, Functions, and Methods

- **main.py**
  - `create_app()`: Initializes the FastAPI application and sets up routes.
  - `get_students()`: Retrieves all students from the database.
  - `create_student()`: Creates a new student in the database.

- **models.py**
  - `Student`: SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.

- **database.py**
  - `get_db()`: Provides a database session for each request.

- **schemas.py**
  - `StudentCreate`: Pydantic model for creating a new student.
  - `StudentResponse`: Pydantic model for returning student data.

- **gui.py**
  - `create_gui()`: Sets up the Tkinter GUI for user interaction.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly. Here’s the detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `FastAPI` framework and necessary components for creating the API are missing in `main.py`. 

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The FastAPI application and its routes are not defined in `main.py`.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are lacking in the `main.py` file, which is essential for understanding the code.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The lack of API route definitions in `main.py` will lead to runtime errors when trying to access the API.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is good, but the API functionality is incomplete.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI in `gui.py` cannot interact with the FastAPI application because the API is not set up.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the FastAPI application and its routes are not defined in `main.py`, which prevents the application from functioning as intended. 

### Suggestions for Revision:
To fix this, you need to implement the FastAPI application and define the necessary API routes in `main.py`. Below is a suggested implementation for `main.py`:

```python
'''
Main application file for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import engine, get_db
from models import Student
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

# Create the FastAPI instance
app = FastAPI()

# Create the database tables on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    from database import Base
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# API endpoint to create a new student
@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

# API endpoint to get all students
@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Instructions:
1. Replace the content of `main.py` with the provided code.
2. Ensure that you have the FastAPI and SQLAlchemy libraries installed in your environment.
3. Run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
4. Test the API endpoints using the GUI or tools like Postman to ensure everything works as expected.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable and meet the requirements specified by the customer.

### Instructions:
1. Replace the content of `main.py` with the provided code.
2. Ensure that you have the FastAPI and SQLAlchemy libraries installed in your environment.
3. Run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
4. Test the API endpoints using the GUI or tools like Postman to ensure everything works as expected.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable and meet the requirements specified by the customer."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

All methods should be implemented: \n   - The FastAPI application and its routes are not defined in main.py.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - Comments are lacking in the main.py file, which is essential for understanding the code.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The lack of API route definitions in main.py will lead to runtime errors when trying to access the API.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The project structure is good, but the API functionality is incomplete.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement*: \n   - The GUI in gui.py cannot interact with the FastAPI application because the API is not set up.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is that the FastAPI application and its routes are not defined in main.py, which prevents the application from functioning as intended. \n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\nTo fix this, you need to implement the FastAPI application and define the necessary API routes in main.py.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and the task requirements. Here is my comment with the highest priority:

### Comment:
The FastAPI application is missing the main application file (`main.py`) that sets up the FastAPI instance, defines the API endpoints, and integrates the database session management. This is crucial for the application to function correctly and respond to API requests.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create the FastAPI Application**: You need to set up the FastAPI application in `main.py` and define the necessary API endpoints for creating and retrieving students.

2. **Implement API Endpoints**: Add endpoints to handle the creation of a student and to retrieve all students.

3. **Import Required Classes**: Ensure that all necessary classes and functions are imported in `main.py`.

Here is an example of how `main.py` could be structured:

```python
'''
Main application file for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import engine, get_db
from models import Student
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

# Create the FastAPI instance
app = FastAPI()

# Create the database tables
from models import Base
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Instructions:
1. Add the above code to `main.py` to set up the FastAPI application.
2. Ensure that the FastAPI server is started by running `uvicorn main:app --reload` in the terminal.
3. Test the API endpoints using the GUI or a tool like Postman to ensure they work as expected.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable and meet the customer's requirements effectively.

The FastAPI application is missing the main application file (`main.py`) that sets up the FastAPI instance, defines the API endpoints, and integrates the database session management. This is crucial for the application to function correctly and respond to API requests.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create the FastAPI Application**: You need to set up the FastAPI application in `main.py` and define the necessary API endpoints for creating and retrieving students.

2. **Implement API Endpoints**: Add endpoints to handle the creation of a student and to retrieve all students.

3. **Import Required Classes**: Ensure that all necessary classes and functions are imported in `main.py`.

Here is an example of how `main.py` could be structured:

```python
'''
Main application file for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import engine, get_db
from models import Student
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

# Create the FastAPI instance
app = FastAPI()

# Create the database tables
from models import Base
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/", response_model=list[StudentResponse])
def read_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return students
```

### Instructions:
1. Add the above code to `main.py` to set up the FastAPI application.
2. Ensure that the FastAPI server is started by running `uvicorn main:app --reload` in the terminal.
3. Test the API endpoints using the GUI or a tool like Postman to ensure they work as expected.

By implementing these changes, the application will be operable and meet the customer's requirements effectively."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the functionality of the application. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The FastAPI application is missing the actual API routes to handle the creation and retrieval of Student entities. Without these routes, the application will not be operable as intended, and users will not be able to interact with the Student entity through HTTP requests.

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Create a FastAPI application in `main.py`**:
   - Import necessary modules from FastAPI and the database.
   - Define the API routes for creating and retrieving students.

Here is an updated version of `main.py` with the necessary API routes:

```python
'''
Main application file for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import engine, get_db
from models import Base, Student
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

# Create the FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Create the database tables
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/{student_id}", response_model=StudentResponse)
def read_student(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if db_student is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return db_student
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added FastAPI imports and created an instance of the FastAPI application.
- Defined a POST route to create a new student and a GET route to retrieve a student by ID.
- Ensured that the database schema is created automatically on startup.

### Final Instructions:
1. Replace the content of `main.py` with the updated code provided above.
2. Ensure that the FastAPI server is running by executing `uvicorn main:app --reload` in the terminal.
3. Test the API endpoints using the GUI or a tool like Postman to ensure functionality.

By implementing these changes, the application will be fully operable, allowing users to create and retrieve Student entities as required. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified several areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the functionality of the application. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The FastAPI application is missing the actual API routes to handle the creation and retrieval of Student entities. Without these routes, the application will not be operable as intended, and users will not be able to interact with the Student entity through HTTP requests.

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Create a FastAPI application in `main.py`**:
   - Import necessary modules from FastAPI and the database.
   - Define the API routes for creating and retrieving students.

Here is an updated version of `main.py` with the necessary API routes:

```python
'''
Main application file for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import engine, get_db
from models import Base, Student
from schemas import StudentCreate, StudentResponse

# Create the FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Create the database tables
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

@app.post("/students/", response_model=StudentResponse)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return db_student

@app.get("/students/{student_id}", response_model=StudentResponse)
def read_student(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if db_student is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return db_student
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added FastAPI imports and created an instance of the FastAPI application.
- Defined a POST route to create a new student and a GET route to retrieve a student by ID.
- Ensured that the database schema is created automatically on startup.

### Final Instructions:
1. Replace the content of `main.py` with the updated code provided above.
2. Ensure that the FastAPI server is running by executing `uvicorn main:app --reload` in the terminal.
3. Test the API endpoints using the GUI or a tool like Postman to ensure functionality.

By implementing these changes, the application will be fully operable, allowing users to create and retrieve Student entities as required.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code structure and the requirements for the FastAPI web application, the `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary dependencies for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (for database interaction), and an ASGI server like Uvicorn to run the application. Here’s how the `requirements.txt` file should look:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The main framework for building the web application.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions with SQLite.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization.

Make sure to adjust the version numbers as necessary based on your project's requirements or the latest stable releases.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
