To address the customer's task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be to use a **Document** format, where we can provide detailed explanations of the changes made to the database schema, including the relationship between Course and Teacher entities. This would allow us to include diagrams and textual descriptions.

Alternatively, a **Dashboard** could be beneficial, as it would allow us to visualize the relationships in real-time, showing how courses are linked to their respective teachers. This could provide a more interactive experience for the users.

We could also consider a **Website** format, which would allow us to present the information in a more dynamic way, potentially including interactive elements that showcase the relationship between courses and teachers.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you have a preference or any other ideas?

I appreciate your insights on the different modalities. 

A **Document** format would indeed allow for thorough explanations and detailed diagrams, which could be beneficial for understanding the technical aspects of the changes. However, it may lack interactivity.

On the other hand, a **Dashboard** could provide a more engaging experience, allowing users to see real-time data and relationships visually. This could be particularly useful for educators and administrators who want to quickly understand the connections between courses and teachers.

The **Website** option also has its merits, as it can combine text, visuals, and interactivity, making it accessible to a wider audience.

Considering the need for clarity and interactivity, I lean towards the **Dashboard** format. It would effectively showcase the relationships while allowing for real-time updates.

What do you think? Should we proceed with the Dashboard, or do you have a different preference?

I agree with your assessment of the Dashboard format. It indeed strikes a balance between clarity and interactivity, allowing users to visualize the relationships between courses and teachers effectively. The ability to display real-time data can enhance user engagement and provide valuable insights for educators and administrators.

Given the importance of understanding these relationships dynamically, I believe the Dashboard would be the most suitable choice for this task. 

If you are in agreement, we can finalize our decision. Shall we proceed with the Dashboard?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a significant oversight regarding the requirement to establish a relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities. Specifically, the `Course` model does not currently include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model, which is essential to fulfill the task requirements. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Implementation:** The `Course` model should have a foreign key that references the `Teacher` model to establish the relationship where a course can have a teacher.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py`** to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
       teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model in `models.py`** to establish a back-reference:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)
       courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas in `schemas.py`** to include the `teacher_id`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str
       teacher_id: int  # Add this line

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str
       teacher_id: int  # Add this line
       students: List[int]
   ```

4. **Update the `create_course` endpoint in `api.py`** to handle the `teacher_id`:
   ```python
   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course
   ```

5. **Create a new migration script** to add the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table and ensure existing data is preserved:
   ```python
   '''
   Migration script to add teacher_id to courses table.
   '''
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   revision = 'xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship'
   down_revision = 'xxxxxx_add_teacher_table'  # Update to reflect the correct previous migration revision
   branch_labels = None
   depends_on = None

   def upgrade():
       op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_column('courses', 'teacher_id')
   ```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher` will be established correctly, fulfilling the customer's requirements. Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the software operates as intended.

       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course
   ```

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a significant oversight regarding the requirement to establish a relationship between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities. Specifically, the `Course` model does not currently include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model, which is essential to fulfill the task requirements. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Implementation:** The `Course` model should have a foreign key that references the `Teacher` model to establish the relationship where a course can have a teacher.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model in `models.py`** to include a foreign key reference to the `Teacher` model:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'courses'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
       teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model in `models.py`** to establish a back-reference:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)
       courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Update the `CourseCreate` and `CourseResponse` schemas in `schemas.py`** to include the `teacher_id`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str
       teacher_id: int  # Add this line

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str
       teacher_id: int  # Add this line
       students: List[int]
   ```

4. **Update the `create_course` endpoint in `api.py`** to handle the `teacher_id`:
   ```python
   @router.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level, teacher_id=course.teacher_id)  # Update this line
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course
   ```

5. **Create a new migration script** to add the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table and ensure existing data is preserved:
   ```python
   '''
   Migration script to add teacher_id to courses table.
   '''
   from alembic import op
   import sqlalchemy as sa

   revision = 'xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship'
   down_revision = 'xxxxxx_add_teacher_table'  # Update to reflect the correct previous migration revision
   branch_labels = None
   depends_on = None

   def upgrade():
       op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_column('courses', 'teacher_id')
   ```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher` will be established correctly, fulfilling the customer's requirements. Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the software operates as intended."

[2025-28-10 08:36:20 INFO] Code Reviewer: **Code Reviewer<->Programmer on : CodeReviewComment, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the migration scripts and the relationship implementation between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` is not correctly set up to ensure that the existing `Course` records can be associated with `Teacher` records. Specifically, the `teacher_id` column is added to the `courses` table, but there is no migration logic to ensure that existing courses can be linked to teachers without losing data integrity.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the Migration Script**: Modify the `upgrade()` method in `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` to include logic that populates the `teacher_id` for existing courses, if applicable. This could involve setting a default teacher or allowing for null values while ensuring that the database schema remains consistent.

2. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Before adding the `teacher_id` column, ensure that the existing data in the `courses` table can accommodate this change without violating foreign key constraints.

Here’s an example of how you might modify the `upgrade()` method:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add the teacher_id column to the courses table
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))
    
    # Optionally, set a default teacher_id for existing courses if applicable
    # This assumes you have a default teacher with id=1, adjust as necessary
    op.execute("UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = 1 WHERE teacher_id IS NULL")
```

### Additional Considerations:
- Ensure that the `teacher_id` column is nullable if you want to allow courses without an assigned teacher.
- If there are existing courses that should not have a teacher assigned, consider how to handle those cases during the migration.
- Test the migration thoroughly to ensure that existing data is preserved and that the application behaves as expected after the migration.

Following these suggestions will help ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements without losing any existing functionality or data integrity.

### Final Note:
After implementing the suggested changes, please run the migration and test the application to confirm that the new relationships are functioning as intended.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Specifically, the teacher_id column is added to the courses table, but there is no migration logic to ensure that existing courses can be linked to teachers without losing data integrity.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Update the Migration Script: Modify the upgrade() method in xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py to include logic that populates the teacher_id for existing courses, if applicable. This could involve setting a default teacher or allowing for null values while ensuring that the database schema remains consistent.\n\n2. Ensure Data Integrity: Before adding the teacher_id column, ensure that the existing data in the courses table can accommodate this change without violating foreign key constraints.\n\nHere’s an example of how you might modify the upgrade() method:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Add the teacher_id column to the courses table\n    op.add_column(\'courses\', sa.Column(\'teacher_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'teachers.id\'), nullable=True))\n    \n    # Optionally, set a default teacher_id for existing courses if applicable\n    # This assumes you have a default teacher with id=1, adjust as necessary\n    op.execute("UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = 1 WHERE teacher_id IS NULL")\n\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Ensure that the teacher_id column is nullable if you want to allow courses without an assigned teacher.\n- If there are existing courses that should not have a teacher assigned, consider how to handle those cases during the migration.\n- Test the migration thoroughly to ensure that existing data is preserved and that the application behaves as expected after the migration.\n\nFollowing these suggestions will help ensure that the application meets the customer\'s requirements without losing any existing functionality or data integrity.\n\n### Final Note:\nAfter implementing the suggested changes, please run the migration and test the application to confirm that the new relationships are functioning as intended.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the migration scripts and the relationship implementation between the `Course` and `Teacher` entities. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` is not correctly set up to ensure that the existing `Course` records can be associated with `Teacher` records. Specifically, the `teacher_id` column is added to the `courses` table, but there is no migration logic to ensure that existing courses can be linked to teachers without losing data integrity.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the Migration Script**: Modify the `upgrade()` method in `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` to include logic that populates the `teacher_id` for existing courses, if applicable. This could involve setting a default teacher or allowing for null values while ensuring that the database schema remains consistent.

2. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Before adding the `teacher_id` column, ensure that the existing data in the `courses` table can accommodate this change without violating foreign key constraints.

Here’s an example of how you might modify the `upgrade()` method:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add the teacher_id column to the courses table
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))
    
    # Optionally, set a default teacher_id for existing courses if applicable
    # This assumes you have a default teacher with id=1, adjust as necessary
    op.execute("UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = 1 WHERE teacher_id IS NULL")
```

### Additional Considerations:
- Ensure that the `teacher_id` column is nullable if you want to allow courses without an assigned teacher.
- If there are existing courses that should not have a teacher assigned, consider how to handle those cases during the migration.
- Test the migration thoroughly to ensure that existing data is preserved and that the application behaves as expected after the migration.

Following these suggestions will help ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements without losing any existing functionality or data integrity.

### Final Note:
After implementing the suggested changes, please run the migration and test the application to confirm that the new relationships are functioning as intended.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary adjustments based on the comments provided. The migration script `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` has been updated to ensure data integrity and to populate the `teacher_id` for existing courses if applicable.

Specifically, the teacher_id column is added to the courses table, but there is no migration logic to ensure that existing courses can be linked to teachers without losing data integrity.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Update the Migration Script: Modify the upgrade() method in xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py to include logic that populates the teacher_id for existing courses, if applicable. This could involve setting a default teacher or allowing for null values while ensuring that the database schema remains consistent.\n\n2. Ensure Data Integrity: Before adding the teacher_id column, ensure that the existing data in the courses table can accommodate this change without violating foreign key constraints.\n\nHere’s an example of how you might modify the upgrade() method:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Add the teacher_id column to the courses table\n    op.add_column(\'courses\', sa.Column(\'teacher_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'teachers.id\'), nullable=True))\n    \n    # Optionally, set a default teacher_id for existing courses if applicable\n    # This assumes you have a default teacher with id=1, adjust as necessary\n    op.execute("UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = 1 WHERE teacher_id IS NULL")\n\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Ensure that the teacher_id column is nullable if you want to allow courses without an assigned teacher.\n- If there are existing courses that should not have a teacher assigned, consider how to handle those cases during the migration.\n- Test the migration thoroughly to ensure that existing data is preserved and that the application behaves as expected after the migration.\n\nFollowing these suggestions will help ensure that the application meets the customer\'s requirements without losing any existing functionality or data integrity.\n\n### Final Note:\nAfter implementing the suggested changes, please run the migration and test the application to confirm that the new relationships are functioning as intended.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the customer's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` is designed to add the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table, but it does not ensure that the existing data is preserved correctly. Specifically, the line `op.execute("UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = 1 WHERE teacher_id IS NULL")` assumes that there is a teacher with `id=1`, which may not be the case. This could lead to data integrity issues if there are no teachers in the database or if the teacher with `id=1` does not exist.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Modify the migration script to either:
   - Set `teacher_id` to `NULL` for existing courses if no default teacher is available, or
   - Create a mechanism to ensure that a valid `teacher_id` is assigned based on existing teachers in the database.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function in `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add the teacher_id column to the courses table
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))
    
    # Optionally, set a default teacher_id for existing courses if applicable
    # Check if there are any teachers in the database
    connection = op.get_bind()
    result = connection.execute("SELECT id FROM teachers LIMIT 1")
    teacher_id = result.fetchone()
    
    if teacher_id:
        # If a teacher exists, set the teacher_id for existing courses
        op.execute("UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = (SELECT id FROM teachers LIMIT 1) WHERE teacher_id IS NULL")
    else:
        # If no teachers exist, leave teacher_id as NULL
        pass
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the `xxxxxx_add_teacher_table.py` migration script is executed before `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` to maintain the correct order of migrations.
- Test the migration thoroughly in a development environment to ensure that data integrity is maintained and that no existing data is lost.

By implementing these changes, you will enhance the robustness of the migration process and ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements without risking data integrity.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the `xxxxxx_add_teacher_table.py` migration script is executed before `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` to maintain the correct order of migrations.
- Test the migration thoroughly in a development environment to ensure that data integrity is maintained and that no existing data is lost.

By implementing these changes, you will enhance the robustness of the migration process and ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements without risking data integrity.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the customer's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` is designed to add the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table, but it does not ensure that the existing data is preserved correctly. Specifically, the line `op.execute("UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = 1 WHERE teacher_id IS NULL")` assumes that there is a teacher with `id=1`, which may not be the case. This could lead to data integrity issues if there are no teachers in the database or if the teacher with `id=1` does not exist.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Modify the migration script to either:
   - Set `teacher_id` to `NULL` for existing courses if no default teacher is available, or
   - Create a mechanism to ensure that a valid `teacher_id` is assigned based on existing teachers in the database.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function in `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add the teacher_id column to the courses table
    op.add_column('courses', sa.Column('teacher_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('teachers.id'), nullable=True))
    
    # Optionally, set a default teacher_id for existing courses if applicable
    # Check if there are any teachers in the database
    connection = op.get_bind()
    result = connection.execute("SELECT id FROM teachers LIMIT 1")
    teacher_id = result.fetchone()
    
    if teacher_id:
        # If a teacher exists, set the teacher_id for existing courses
        op.execute("UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = (SELECT id FROM teachers LIMIT 1) WHERE teacher_id IS NULL")
    else:
        # If no teachers exist, leave teacher_id as NULL
        pass
```

### Additional Recommendations:
- Ensure that the `xxxxxx_add_teacher_table.py` migration script is executed before `xxxxxx_add_teacher_relationship.py` to maintain the correct order of migrations.
- Test the migration thoroughly in a development environment to ensure that data integrity is maintained and that no existing data is lost.

By implementing these changes, you will enhance the robustness of the migration process and ensure that the application meets the customer's requirements without risking data integrity.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)
