# Teacher Management System

A simple web application for managing teachers, students, and courses.

## Overview

The Teacher Management System allows users to create and manage Teacher entities, which include essential information such as name and email. The application is built using Python and utilizes FastAPI for the web framework, SQLAlchemy for database interactions, and Pydantic for data validation.

### Main Functions

- **Create Teacher**: Allows users to create a new teacher with a name and email.
- **Database Management**: Automatically manages the database schema, ensuring that existing Student and Course data is preserved during migrations.
- **Validation**: Utilizes Pydantic schemas to validate incoming data for creating teachers and returning teacher data.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   pydantic
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Database Setup

The application uses SQLite as the database. The database schema will be automatically created when you run the migration script.

### Running Migrations

To set up the database and create the necessary tables, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will create the `teachers`, `students`, and `courses` tables in the `students.db` SQLite database.

## How to Use the Application

### Starting the Application

To start the FastAPI application, run:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### API Endpoints

- **Create a Teacher**:
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /teachers`
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```

### Accessing the API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`. This documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and provides an easy way to test the API endpoints.

## Conclusion

The Teacher Management System is a straightforward application designed to help manage teacher data efficiently. By following the installation and usage instructions, you can set up the application and start creating teacher records seamlessly.
