To address the customer's task of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information effectively. 

One option could be a **Document** format, where we can provide detailed documentation of the changes made to the database schema, including the relationship between Course and Teacher. This would allow for clear explanations and instructions.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Dashboard** that visualizes the relationships between Courses and Teachers in real-time, which could be beneficial for users who want to see this data dynamically.

Another possibility is to use a **Website** format, where we can create a dedicated page that outlines the new relationship, including examples and possibly interactive elements to enhance understanding.

What are your thoughts on these options? Do you have a preference for one modality over the others?

I appreciate your insights on the various modalities. 

I believe a **Dashboard** could be particularly effective for this task, as it would allow users to visualize the relationship between Courses and Teachers in real-time. This dynamic representation can enhance user understanding and engagement, especially for educational institutions that may want to track these relationships actively.

However, I also see the value in a **Document** format for providing comprehensive details and instructions regarding the database schema changes. 

Ultimately, I think we should prioritize the Dashboard for its interactive capabilities, but we could also consider creating supplementary documentation to support it.

What do you think about focusing on the Dashboard as our primary modality while providing additional documentation?

I agree that focusing on the **Dashboard** as our primary modality is a strong choice. The interactive and visual nature of a Dashboard will allow users to easily understand and engage with the relationship between Courses and Teachers. This is particularly valuable in an educational context where real-time data can significantly enhance decision-making and tracking.

Additionally, providing supplementary documentation would be beneficial to ensure that users have access to detailed information about the database schema changes and the implementation process. This combination of a dynamic Dashboard with supporting documentation will cater to different user needs effectively.

Shall we finalize our decision to proceed with the Dashboard as the primary modality, along with supplementary documentation?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a few areas that need attention to meet the requirements of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The `Teacher` class is defined in `models.py` but is not referenced in the `Course` model. You need to import the `Teacher` class and establish a relationship in the `Course` model.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The migration script in `main.py` does not include the necessary migration logic to add a foreign key relationship from `Course` to `Teacher`. This needs to be implemented.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - The comments are generally adequate, but the migration logic could benefit from more detailed comments explaining each step.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The current code does not handle the migration of the new foreign key relationship properly, which could lead to issues when trying to access the teacher associated with a course.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project does not currently conform to the task requirements as the relationship between `Course` and `Teacher` is not established.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The lack of a relationship between `Course` and `Teacher` means that the user cannot assign a teacher to a course, which is a core requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the `Course` model does not have a relationship with the `Teacher` model, and the database migration does not account for this new relationship. 

### Suggestions on Revision:
1. **Update the `Course` model** in `models.py` to include a foreign key relationship to the `Teacher` model:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       '''Database model for the Course entity.'''
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       teacher_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teachers.id'))  # Add this line
       students = relationship("Student", secondary="student_courses", back_populates="courses")
       teacher = relationship("Teacher", back_populates="courses")  # Add this line
   ```

2. **Update the `Teacher` model** to include a back-reference:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       '''Database model for the Teacher entity.'''
       __tablename__ = "teachers"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship("Course", back_populates="teacher")  # Add this line
   ```

3. **Modify the migration script** in `main.py` to include the creation of the foreign key relationship:
   ```python
   def migrate_database():
       '''Migrate the database to add email column to the students table and create Teacher table.'''
       with engine.connect() as connection:
           # Create tables if they don't exist
           Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # This will create all tables including the Teacher table
           # Add email column if it doesn't exist
           # Existing logic for email column...
           # Add foreign key relationship for Course to Teacher
           connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER;'))
           connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers(id);'))
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirements of the task and allow for proper interaction with the Course and Teacher entities. 

### Final Note:
After making these changes, ensure to run the migration script to update the database schema accordingly.

           connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER;'))
           connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers(id);'))
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirements of the task and allow for proper interaction with the Course and Teacher entities. 

### Final Note:
After making these changes, ensure to run the migration script to update the database schema accordingly.

Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To fulfill the customer's request of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity, we will need to make several modifications to the existing code. This includes updating the `models.py` to establish a relationship between `Course` and `Teacher`, updating the `schemas.py` to include the teacher information, and modifying the migration script in `main.py` to ensure the database schema is updated accordingly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally adheres to the requirements of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity. However, there are a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Migration Logic Needs Improvement:**
The migration script in `main.py` does not include the necessary logic to add the `teachers` table and the foreign key relationship for the `teacher_id` in the `courses` table. While the `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` will create the tables, it does not handle the migration of existing data or the addition of the `teacher_id` column in a way that preserves existing data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the Migration Logic:**
   - Modify the `migrate_database` function to include the creation of the `teachers` table explicitly if it does not exist.
   - Ensure that the `teacher_id` column is added to the `courses` table if it does not exist, and handle any potential data migration or default values appropriately.

Here’s an example of how you might revise the `migrate_database` function:

```python
def migrate_database():
    '''Migrate the database to add email column to the students table, create Teacher table, and add teacher_id to courses.'''
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Check if the email column already exists
        result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students);"))
        columns = [row[1] for row in result]
        
        # Create tables if they don't exist
        Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # This will create all tables including the Teacher table
        
        # Add email column if it doesn't exist
        if 'email' not in columns:
            connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT;'))
        else:
            print("Email column already exists in the students table.")
        
        # Check if the teachers table exists
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='teachers';"))
        if not result.fetchone():
            # Create the teachers table if it doesn't exist
            connection.execute(text('CREATE TABLE teachers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL);'))
        
        # Check if the teacher_id column exists in courses
        result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(courses);"))
        columns = [row[1] for row in result]
        if 'teacher_id' not in columns:
            connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER;'))
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database migration preserves existing data and correctly sets up the new relationships as required by the customer. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the software operates as intended without losing any features.

Update the Migration Logic:\n   - Modify the migrate_database function to include the creation of the teachers table explicitly if it does not exist.\n   - Ensure that the teacher_id column is added to the courses table if it does not exist, and handle any potential data migration or default values appropriately.\n\nHere’s an example of how you might revise the migrate_database function:\n\npython\ndef migrate_database():\n    \'\'\'Migrate the database to add email column to the students table, create Teacher table, and add teacher_id to courses.\'\'\'\n    with engine.connect() as connection:\n        # Check if the email column already exists\n        result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students);"))\n        columns = [row[1] for row in result]\n        \n        # Create tables if they don\'t exist\n        Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # This will create all tables including the Teacher table\n        \n        # Add email column if it doesn\'t exist\n        if \'email\' not in columns:\n            connection.execute(text(\'ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT;\'))\n        else:\n            print("Email column already exists in the students table.")\n        \n        # Check if the teachers table exists\n        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type=\'table\' AND name=\'teachers\';"))\n        if not result.fetchone():\n            # Create the teachers table if it doesn\'t exist\n            connection.execute(text(\'CREATE TABLE teachers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL);\'))\n        \n        # Check if the teacher_id column exists in courses\n        result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(courses);"))\n        columns = [row[1] for row in result]\n        if \'teacher_id\' not in columns:\n            connection.execute(text(\'ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER;\'))\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database migration preserves existing data and correctly sets up the new relationships as required by the customer. \n\nPlease proceed with these revisions to ensure the software operates as intended without losing any features.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided generally adheres to the requirements of adding a teacher relationship to the Course entity. However, there are a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Migration Logic Needs Improvement:**
The migration script in `main.py` does not include the necessary logic to add the `teachers` table and the foreign key relationship for the `teacher_id` in the `courses` table. While the `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` will create the tables, it does not handle the migration of existing data or the addition of the `teacher_id` column in a way that preserves existing data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the Migration Logic:**
   - Modify the `migrate_database` function to include the creation of the `teachers` table explicitly if it does not exist.
   - Ensure that the `teacher_id` column is added to the `courses` table if it does not exist, and handle any potential data migration or default values appropriately.

Here’s an example of how you might revise the `migrate_database` function:

```python
def migrate_database():
    '''Migrate the database to add email column to the students table, create Teacher table, and add teacher_id to courses.'''
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Check if the email column already exists
        result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students);"))
        columns = [row[1] for row in result]
        
        # Create tables if they don't exist
        Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # This will create all tables including the Teacher table
        
        # Add email column if it doesn't exist
        if 'email' not in columns:
            connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT;'))
        else:
            print("Email column already exists in the students table.")
        
        # Check if the teachers table exists
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='teachers';"))
        if not result.fetchone():
            # Create the teachers table if it doesn't exist
            connection.execute(text('CREATE TABLE teachers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL);'))
        
        # Check if the teacher_id column exists in courses
        result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(courses);"))
        columns = [row[1] for row in result]
        if 'teacher_id' not in columns:
            connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER;'))
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database migration preserves existing data and correctly sets up the new relationships as required by the customer. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the software operates as intended without losing any features."

However, there are a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev. \n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nMigration Logic Needs Improvement:\nThe migration script in main.py does not include the necessary logic to add the teachers table and the foreign key relationship for the teacher_id in the courses table. While the Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine) will create the tables, it does not handle the migration of existing data or the addition of the teacher_id column in a way that preserves existing data.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Update the Migration Logic:\n   - Modify the migrate_database function to include the creation of the teachers table explicitly if it does not exist.\n   - Ensure that the teacher_id column is added to the courses table if it does not exist, and handle any potential data migration or default values appropriately.\n\nHere’s an example of how you might revise the migrate_database function:\n\npython\ndef migrate_database():\n    \'\'\'Migrate the database to add email column to the students table, create Teacher table, and add teacher_id to courses.\'\'\'\n    with engine.connect() as connection:\n        # Check if the email column already exists\n        result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students);"))\n        columns = [row[1] for row in result]\n        \n        # Create tables if they don\'t exist\n        Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # This will create all tables including the Teacher table\n        \n        # Add email column if it doesn\'t exist\n        if \'email\' not in columns:\n            connection.execute(text(\'ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT;\'))\n        else:\n            print("Email column already exists in the students table.")\n        \n        # Check if the teachers table exists\n        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type=\'table\' AND name=\'teachers\';"))\n        if not result.fetchone():\n            # Create the teachers table if it doesn\'t exist\n            connection.execute(text(\'CREATE TABLE teachers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL);\'))\n        \n        # Check if the teacher_id column exists in courses\n        result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(courses);"))\n        columns = [row[1] for row in result]\n        if \'teacher_id\' not in columns:\n            connection.execute(text(\'ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER;\'))\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that the database migration preserves existing data and correctly sets up the new relationships as required by the customer. \n\nPlease proceed with these revisions to ensure the software operates as intended without losing any features.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few areas that require attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the functionality of the software. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The imports in `main.py` are sufficient for the migration script. However, ensure that all necessary classes are imported in other files where they are used.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented, but the migration logic could be improved for clarity.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are present, but some could be more descriptive, especially in `migrate_database()`.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free of syntax errors, but the migration logic could lead to issues if the database schema changes in the future. Specifically, the migration script does not handle existing data when adding new columns.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The task requirements are met, including the addition of the teacher relationship to the Course entity.

6. **User interaction with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The code structure allows for user interaction, but the migration logic could be improved to ensure data integrity.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script in `main.py` does not handle existing data properly when adding the `teacher_id` column to the `courses` table. If there are existing courses, they will not have a teacher associated with them after the migration, which could lead to data integrity issues.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Modify the Migration Logic**: 
   - When adding the `teacher_id` column, consider setting a default value (e.g., `NULL`) or ensuring that existing courses are updated with a valid teacher ID if applicable.

2. **Add Data Integrity Checks**: 
   - Before adding new columns, check if the existing data can be preserved or updated accordingly.

Here’s a suggested revision for the migration logic in `main.py`:

```python
def migrate_database():
    '''Migrate the database to add email column to the students table, create Teacher table, and add teacher_id to courses.'''
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        # Check if the email column already exists
        result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(students);"))
        columns = [row[1] for row in result]
        # Create tables if they don't exist
        Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)  # This will create all tables including the Teacher table
        # Add email column if it doesn't exist
        if 'email' not in columns:
            connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT;'))
        else:
            print("Email column already exists in the students table.")
        # Check if the teachers table exists
        result = connection.execute(text("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='teachers';"))
        if not result.fetchone():
            # Create the teachers table if it doesn't exist
            connection.execute(text('CREATE TABLE teachers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL);'))
        # Check if the teacher_id column exists in courses
        result = connection.execute(text("PRAGMA table_info(courses);"))
        columns = [row[1] for row in result]
        if 'teacher_id' not in columns:
            connection.execute(text('ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN teacher_id INTEGER;'))
            # Optionally, update existing courses with a default teacher_id if needed
            # connection.execute(text('UPDATE courses SET teacher_id = NULL;'))  # or set to a specific teacher ID
```

This ensures that the migration process is more robust and maintains data integrity.

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Add teacher relationship to Course entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship from Course to Teacher entity
- Course should be able to have a teacher
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student, Course, and Teacher data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the typical dependencies required for a Python project that uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Pydantic for data validation, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
SQLAlchemy==1.4.27
Pydantic==1.8.2
fastapi==0.68.1  # If you're using FastAPI for the web framework
uvicorn==0.15.0  # ASGI server for running FastAPI applications
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **SQLAlchemy**: This is the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used in your project for database interactions.
- **Pydantic**: This library is used for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **FastAPI**: If your application is intended to be a web application, FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Uvicorn**: This is an ASGI server that is commonly used to run FastAPI applications.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project's requirements or the latest stable releases if necessary.

```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code and the typical dependencies required for a Python project that uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Pydantic for data validation, here is a suitable `requirements.txt` file:
```plaintext
SQLAlchemy==1.4.27
Pydantic==1.8.2
fastapi==0.68.1  # If you're using FastAPI for the web framework
uvicorn==0.15.0  # ASGI server for running FastAPI applications
```
### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **SQLAlchemy**: This is the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used in your project for database interactions.
- **Pydantic**: This library is used for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **FastAPI**: If your application is intended to be a web application, FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Uvicorn**: This is an ASGI server that is commonly used to run FastAPI applications.
Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project's requirements or the latest stable releases if necessary. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
