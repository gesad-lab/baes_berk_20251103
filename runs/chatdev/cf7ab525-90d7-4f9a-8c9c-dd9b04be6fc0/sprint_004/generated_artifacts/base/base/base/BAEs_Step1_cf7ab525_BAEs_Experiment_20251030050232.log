To address the customer's task of creating a simple web application for a Student entity, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a "Website." This modality allows us to create an interactive web application that can effectively handle the API requests and responses in JSON format, while also providing a user-friendly interface for managing the Student entity.

What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that a "Website" is a suitable product modality for this task. It allows us to create a user interface for interacting with the Student entity while also fulfilling the requirements for API responses in JSON format. This approach will provide a seamless experience for users and make it easier to manage the data.

Let's finalize our decision. What do you think?

I completely agree with your assessment. A "Website" is indeed the best choice for this task, as it aligns perfectly with the customer's needs and allows for both API functionality and user interaction.

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure the application into multiple files. The application will also include a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app and the SQLite database.
   - `create_app()`: Initializes the FastAPI application.
   - `create_database()`: Creates the SQLite database and the Student table if it doesn't exist.
   - `run()`: Starts the FastAPI server.

2. **models.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
   - `Student`: A class representing the Student entity with a name field.

3. **database.py**: Handles database connection and session management.
   - `get_db()`: Provides a database session for each request.

4. **routes.py**: Defines the API endpoints for the Student entity.
   - `create_student()`: Endpoint to create a new student.
   - `get_students()`: Endpoint to retrieve all students.

5. **gui.py**: Implements the GUI using Tkinter to interact with the API.
   - `StudentApp`: A class that creates the GUI for adding and viewing students.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code structure and implementation are mostly correct, but there are some issues that need to be addressed to ensure compliance with the regulations and to improve the overall functionality of the application. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
1. **Missing FastAPI Application Initialization**: The `main.py` file does not contain the FastAPI application setup and routing. This is essential for the application to run properly and to expose the API endpoints defined in `routes.py`.

### Suggested Revision:
To fix this, you need to initialize the FastAPI application in `main.py`, include the routes, and call the `create_database()` function to ensure the database schema is created on startup. Here’s how you can modify `main.py`:

```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from routes import router
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    create_database()

# Include the router for the API endpoints
app.include_router(router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that you have the necessary packages installed (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `sqlalchemy`, `requests`).
- Make sure to run the FastAPI application using `python main.py` and then run the GUI application in a separate terminal.

By implementing these changes, the application will be fully operational, allowing users to interact with the Student entity as required.

### Final Note:
After making the above changes, please test the application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The provided code structure and implementation are mostly correct, but there are some issues that need to be addressed to ensure compliance with the regulations and to improve the overall functionality of the application. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
1. **Missing FastAPI Application Initialization**: The `main.py` file does not contain the FastAPI application setup and routing. This is essential for the application to run properly and to expose the API endpoints defined in `routes.py`.

### Suggested Revision:
To fix this, you need to initialize the FastAPI application in `main.py`, include the routes, and call the `create_database()` function to ensure the database schema is created on startup. Here’s how you can modify `main.py`:

```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from routes import router
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    create_database()

# Include the router for the API endpoints
app.include_router(router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that you have the necessary packages installed (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `sqlalchemy`, `requests`).
- Make sure to run the FastAPI application using `python main.py` and then run the GUI application in a separate terminal.

By implementing these changes, the application will be fully operational, allowing users to interact with the Student entity as required.

### Final Note:
After making the above changes, please test the application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application operates correctly and meets all the regulations set forth. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
1. **Missing FastAPI Initialization and Route Inclusion**: The `main.py` file does not include the FastAPI application initialization or the inclusion of the routes defined in `routes.py`. This is crucial for the application to run and respond to API requests.

### Suggested Revision:
To fix this, you need to add the FastAPI application setup in `main.py`. Here’s how you can modify `main.py`:

```python
'''
Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
'''
from fastapi import FastAPI
from routes import router
from database import create_database

app = FastAPI()

# Create the database schema on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    create_database()

# Include the router for the student routes
app.include_router(router)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

### Additional Comments:
- Ensure that you have `uvicorn` installed to run the FastAPI application.
- The `create_database()` function is called on startup to ensure the database schema is created automatically.

### Summary:
After making the above changes, the application should be operable, and users will be able to interact with the API as required. 

If you implement these changes, the application will meet all the requirements specified by the customer.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code structure and implementation are mostly correct, but there are a few critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application operates as intended. Here’s the review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `routes.py`, the `BaseModel` from `pydantic` should be imported to define the response model correctly.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `create_student` function should accept a `Student` model instance instead of just a string for the name. This is necessary for FastAPI to validate the input correctly.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are generally present, but the comments could be more descriptive, especially in `routes.py`.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The `create_student` function does not handle potential exceptions when adding a student to the database, which could lead to unhandled errors.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is good, and it meets the requirements.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI in `gui.py` is functional, but it should handle cases where the user tries to add a student with an empty name.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is in the `create_student` function in `routes.py`. The function should use a Pydantic model to validate the input data instead of directly accepting a string. This ensures that the API adheres to the expected input structure and provides better error handling.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Create a Pydantic model for the Student input in a new file or within `routes.py`:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. Update the `create_student` function to use this model:
```python
@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
```

3. In `gui.py`, add a check to ensure the name is not empty before making the API call:
```python
def add_student(self):
    name = self.name_entry.get()
    if not name.strip():
        self.output.insert(tk.END, "Name cannot be empty\n")
        return
    response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name})
```

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and user-friendly.

Comments on Codes:
"The code structure and implementation are mostly correct, but there are a few critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application operates as intended. Here’s the review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `routes.py`, the `BaseModel` from `pydantic` should be imported to define the response model correctly.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - The `create_student` function should accept a `Student` model instance instead of just a string for the name. This is necessary for FastAPI to validate the input correctly.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Comments are generally present, but the comments could be more descriptive, especially in `routes.py`.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The `create_student` function does not handle potential exceptions when adding a student to the database, which could lead to unhandled errors.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is good, and it meets the requirements.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI in `gui.py` is functional, but it should handle cases where the user tries to add a student with an empty name.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is in the `create_student` function in `routes.py`. The function should use a Pydantic model to validate the input data instead of directly accepting a string. This ensures that the API adheres to the expected input structure and provides better error handling.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Create a Pydantic model for the Student input in a new file or within `routes.py`:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. Update the `create_student` function to use this model:
```python
@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
```

3. In `gui.py`, add a check to ensure the name is not empty before making the API call:
```python
def add_student(self):
    name = self.name_entry.get()
    if not name.strip():
        self.output.insert(tk.END, "Name cannot be empty\n")
        return
    response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name})
```

By implementing these changes, the application will be more robust and user-friendly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with all the necessary changes implemented according to the comments provided:

**main.py**
```python
'''
Implements the GUI using Tkinter to interact with the API.

import tkinter as tk
import requests

class StudentApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root

        self.students_button.pack()
        self.output = tk.Text(root, height=10, width=50)

            return
        response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/", json={"name": name})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.output.insert(tk.END, f"Added Student: {response.json()}\n")
        else:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = StudentApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
```

**models.py**
```python
'''
Defines the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
'''
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from database import Base

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)

```

**database.py**
```python
'''

'''
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

def create_database():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
```

**routes.py**
```python
'''
Defines the API endpoints for the Student entity.
'''
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str

@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}

@router.get("/students/", response_model=list)
def get_students(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    students = db.query(Student).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return [{"id": student.id, "name": student.name} for student in students]
```

With these modifications, the application is now more robust, user-friendly, and adheres to best practices for structuring a FastAPI application.

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

It seems that the error reported is due to the absence of the `tkinter` module, which is typically included with standard Python installations. However, if the environment does not have `tkinter`, we can provide an alternative approach to ensure the application can run without it. 

Since the requirement is to ensure the application executes smoothly and robustly, I will modify the `main.py` to include a check for the `tkinter` module and provide a fallback message if it is not available. Here are the modified codes:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found, which typically means that the Tkinter library is not installed or not available in the current Python environment. To resolve this issue, we can provide instructions for installing Tkinter, as it is a standard library in Python but may not be included in some distributions.

Here are the modifications based on the error summary:

```

### Explanation:
- I added a try-except block to check for the `tkinter` module import. If it fails, it raises an ImportError with a message instructing the user to install Tkinter. This ensures that the application will not crash silently if Tkinter is not available.

This modification will help users understand the requirement for Tkinter and guide them on how to resolve the issue.

It seems that the error reported is due to the absence of the `tkinter` module, which is typically included with standard Python installations but may not be available in certain environments. To address this, I will modify the `main.py` file to include a check for the `tkinter` module and provide a user-friendly message if it is not found.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
