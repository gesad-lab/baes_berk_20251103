To fulfill the customer's requirement of creating a Teacher entity, we need to consider how we want to present this information. 

One option could be a **Document** format, where we can provide a detailed description of the Teacher entity, including the fields and their specifications. This would allow for clear documentation of the requirements.

Another option is to create a **Dashboard** that visualizes the Teacher entity alongside existing entities like Student and Course. This could provide a more interactive way to manage and view the data.

We could also consider a **Website** format, which would allow us to present the Teacher entity in a more user-friendly manner, potentially with forms for data entry.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I see the value in each of these options. 

- The **Document** format would be great for formal documentation and clarity, especially for stakeholders who need to understand the specifications in detail. 

- The **Dashboard** option would allow for real-time interaction and management of the Teacher entity alongside existing data, which could be beneficial for users who need to see everything in one place.

- The **Website** format could provide a more engaging user experience, especially if we want to allow for easy data entry and retrieval.

Considering the need for both clarity and interactivity, I lean towards the **Dashboard** option, as it would allow us to visualize the Teacher entity in context with other entities. 

What do you think?

I agree with your assessment. The **Dashboard** option indeed strikes a good balance between clarity and interactivity. It allows users to visualize the Teacher entity alongside existing data, making it easier to manage and understand the relationships between different entities. 

Additionally, a dashboard can provide real-time updates, which can be very useful for users who need to monitor changes or updates to the Teacher entity and its interactions with Students and Courses.

Given our shared interest in providing a comprehensive and user-friendly solution, I think we should proceed with the **Dashboard** modality. 

Shall we finalize this decision?

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a solid structure, but it does not include the implementation of the Teacher entity as specified in the customer's task. Here are the detailed checks based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model is not defined or imported in the `models.py` or `api.py` files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for creating or retrieving `Teacher` entities.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for the `Teacher` entity would need comments as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code appears to be free of bugs, but without the `Teacher` entity, the application will not function as required.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not conform to the user's task as the `Teacher` entity is missing.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: The lack of the `Teacher` entity means that users cannot interact with this part of the application.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the `Teacher` entity and its corresponding API endpoints, which are essential to meet the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Teacher Model**: Add a new `Teacher` model in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create API Endpoints**: Add the necessary API endpoints for creating and retrieving teachers in `api.py`:
   ```python
   class Teacher(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

   @router.post("/teachers/", response_model=dict)
   def create_teacher(teacher: Teacher, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Endpoint to create a new teacher.
       '''
       db_teacher = TeacherModel(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return {"id": db_teacher.id, "name": db_teacher.name, "email": db_teacher.email}

   @router.get("/teachers/", response_model=list)
   def get_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Endpoint to retrieve all teachers.
       '''
       teachers = db.query(TeacherModel).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": teacher.id, "name": teacher.name, "email": teacher.email} for teacher in teachers]
   ```

3. **Update Migration Script**: Modify the `migration_script.py` to include the creation of the `teachers` table:
   ```python
   op.create_table(
       'teachers',
       sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
       sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
       sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
   )
   ```

4. **Run Migrations**: Ensure that the migration script is executed to update the database schema.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements and allow for the creation and management of `Teacher` entities.

### Final Instruction:
Please proceed with the above revisions to ensure the application meets the specified requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a solid structure, but it does not include the implementation of the Teacher entity as specified in the customer's task. Here are the detailed checks based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Teacher` model is not defined or imported in the `models.py` or `api.py` files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods for creating or retrieving `Teacher` entities.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for the `Teacher` entity would need comments as well.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code appears to be free of bugs, but without the `Teacher` entity, the application will not function as required.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not conform to the user's task as the `Teacher` entity is missing.

6. **User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement**: The lack of the `Teacher` entity means that users cannot interact with this part of the application.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the absence of the `Teacher` entity and its corresponding API endpoints, which are essential to meet the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Define the Teacher Model**: Add a new `Teacher` model in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Teacher(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'teachers'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create API Endpoints**: Add the necessary API endpoints for creating and retrieving teachers in `api.py`:
   ```python
   class Teacher(BaseModel):
       name: str
       email: EmailStr

   @router.post("/teachers/", response_model=dict)
   def create_teacher(teacher: Teacher, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Endpoint to create a new teacher.
       '''
       db_teacher = TeacherModel(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)
       db.add(db_teacher)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_teacher)
       return {"id": db_teacher.id, "name": db_teacher.name, "email": db_teacher.email}

   @router.get("/teachers/", response_model=list)
   def get_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       '''
       Endpoint to retrieve all teachers.
       '''
       teachers = db.query(TeacherModel).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
       return [{"id": teacher.id, "name": teacher.name, "email": teacher.email} for teacher in teachers]
   ```

3. **Update Migration Script**: Modify the `migration_script.py` to include the creation of the `teachers` table:
   ```python
   op.create_table(
       'teachers',
       sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
       sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
       sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
   )
   ```

4. **Run Migrations**: Ensure that the migration script is executed to update the database schema.

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer's requirements and allow for the creation and management of `Teacher` entities.

### Final Instruction:
Please proceed with the above revisions to ensure the application meets the specified requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here are the detailed checks based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: The Teacher model is not defined or imported in the models.py or api.py files.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: There are no methods for creating or retrieving Teacher entities.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: The existing methods have comments, but the new methods for the Teacher entity would need comments as well.\n\n4. No potential bugs: The existing code appears to be free of bugs, but without the Teacher entity, the application will not function as required.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The project does not conform to the user\'s task as the Teacher entity is missing.\n\n6. User can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement: The lack of the Teacher entity means that users cannot interact with this part of the application.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the absence of the Teacher entity and its corresponding API endpoints, which are essential to meet the customer\'s requirements.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Define the Teacher Model: Add a new Teacher model in models.py:\n   python\n   class Teacher(Base):\n       __tablename__ = \'teachers\'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2. Create API Endpoints: Add the necessary API endpoints for creating and retrieving teachers in api.py:\n   python\n   class Teacher(BaseModel):\n       name: str\n       email: EmailStr\n\n   @router.post("/teachers/", response_model=dict)\n   def create_teacher(teacher: Teacher, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       \'\'\'\n       Endpoint to create a new teacher.\n       \'\'\'\n       db_teacher = TeacherModel(name=teacher.name, email=teacher.email)\n       db.add(db_teacher)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_teacher)\n       return {"id": db_teacher.id, "name": db_teacher.name, "email": db_teacher.email}\n\n   @router.get("/teachers/", response_model=list)\n   def get_teachers(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       \'\'\'\n       Endpoint to retrieve all teachers.\n       \'\'\'\n       teachers = db.query(TeacherModel).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()\n       return [{"id": teacher.id, "name": teacher.name, "email": teacher.email} for teacher in teachers]\n\n\n3. Update Migration Script: Modify the migration_script.py to include the creation of the teachers table:\n   python\n   op.create_table(\n       \'teachers\',\n       sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n       sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n       sa.Column(\'email\', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n   )\n\n\n4. Run Migrations: Ensure that the migration script is executed to update the database schema.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the customer\'s requirements and allow for the creation and management of Teacher entities.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease proceed with the above revisions to ensure the application meets the specified requirements.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script that could potentially lead to data loss or inconsistencies. Here’s the detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: All necessary classes are imported correctly in the `api.py`, `database.py`, and `models.py` files.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: All methods in the API and database management are implemented.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present for most methods, providing clarity on their functionality.

4. **No potential bugs**: There are no apparent bugs in the code, but the migration script has a critical flaw.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project meets the requirements of creating a Teacher entity and updating the database schema.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The migration script does not ensure that existing data in the Student and Course tables is preserved correctly during the migration process.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The migration script (`migration_script.py`) does not check for existing data in the Student and Course tables before creating the Teacher table. While the creation of the Teacher table itself does not directly affect existing data, it is essential to ensure that the migration process does not inadvertently disrupt the integrity of the database.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Modify the Migration Script**: Before creating the Teacher table, ensure that the migration script checks for the existence of the Student and Course tables and that they contain data. You can add checks to ensure that the migration can proceed without issues.

Here’s an updated version of the `upgrade()` function in `migration_script.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Check if the 'students' and 'courses' tables exist before creating the 'teachers' table
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('students'):
        raise Exception("The 'students' table does not exist. Migration cannot proceed.")
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('courses'):
        raise Exception("The 'courses' table does not exist. Migration cannot proceed.")
    
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the migration process is robust and that it checks for the existence of both the Student and Course tables before proceeding to create the Teacher table.

### Conclusion:
Implementing the above suggestions will enhance the robustness of the migration process and ensure that existing data remains intact.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script. The migration script does not ensure that existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved during the upgrade process. This is essential to meet the requirement of preserving existing Student and Course data.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The migration script does not handle data preservation for existing Student and Course records during the creation of the Teacher table.**

### Suggested Revision:
To ensure that existing data is preserved, you should implement a check in the migration script to ensure that the `teachers` table can be created without affecting the existing data. Additionally, you may want to consider adding a mechanism to back up the existing data if necessary, although this is not strictly required by the task.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Check if the 'students' and 'courses' tables exist before creating the 'teachers' table
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('students'):
        raise Exception("The 'students' table does not exist. Migration cannot proceed.")
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('courses'):
        raise Exception("The 'courses' table does not exist. Migration cannot proceed.")
    
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
```

### Instructions:
1. Update the `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py` to include checks for the existence of both the `students` and `courses` tables.
2. Ensure that the migration script is tested to confirm that it runs successfully without data loss.

By implementing this change, you will ensure that the migration process adheres to the requirement of preserving existing data while adding the new Teacher entity.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

The migration script does not ensure that existing data in the students and courses tables is preserved during the upgrade process. This is essential to meet the requirement of preserving existing Student and Course data.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe migration script does not handle data preservation for existing Student and Course records during the creation of the Teacher table.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\nTo ensure that existing data is preserved, you should implement a check in the migration script to ensure that the teachers table can be created without affecting the existing data. Additionally, you may want to consider adding a mechanism to back up the existing data if necessary, although this is not strictly required by the task.\n\nHere’s how you can revise the upgrade function in migration_script.py:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Check if the \'students\' and \'courses\' tables exist before creating the \'teachers\' table\n    if not op.get_bind().has_table(\'students\'):\n        raise Exception("The \'students\' table does not exist.

Update the upgrade function in migration_script.py to include checks for the existence of both the students and courses tables.\n2. Ensure that the migration script is tested to confirm that it runs successfully without data loss.\n\nBy implementing this change, you will ensure that the migration process adheres to the requirement of preserving existing data while adding the new Teacher entity.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script. The migration script does not ensure that existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved during the upgrade process. This is essential to meet the requirement of preserving existing Student and Course data.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The migration script does not handle data preservation for existing Student and Course records during the creation of the Teacher table.**

### Suggested Revision:
To ensure that existing data is preserved, you should implement a check in the migration script to ensure that the `teachers` table can be created without affecting the existing data. Additionally, you may want to consider adding a mechanism to back up the existing data if necessary, although this is not strictly required by the task.

Here’s how you can revise the `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py`:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Check if the 'students' and 'courses' tables exist before creating the 'teachers' table
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('students'):
        raise Exception("The 'students' table does not exist. Migration cannot proceed.")
    if not op.get_bind().has_table('courses'):
        raise Exception("The 'courses' table does not exist. Migration cannot proceed.")
    
    op.create_table(
        'teachers',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
```

### Instructions:
1. Update the `upgrade` function in `migration_script.py` to include checks for the existence of both the `students` and `courses` tables.
2. Ensure that the migration script is tested to confirm that it runs successfully without data loss.

By implementing this change, you will ensure that the migration process adheres to the requirement of preserving existing data while adding the new Teacher entity.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Teacher entity with name and email fields.

Requirements:
- Create Teacher entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - email (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Teacher table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary changes applied according to the comments provided. The migration script has been updated to ensure that existing Student and Course data is preserved during the upgrade process.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

A simple API for managing teachers, students, and courses in an educational environment.

## Main Functions

The Teacher Management System provides the following functionalities:

- **Create and manage teachers**: Add new teachers with their names and email addresses.
- **Create and manage students**: Add new students with their names, email addresses, and enrolled courses.
- **Create and manage courses**: Add new courses with their names and levels.
- **Retrieve data**: Fetch lists of teachers, students, and courses.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd student_app
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   pydantic
   alembic
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:
   Start the FastAPI application by executing:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Access the API documentation**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to access the interactive API documentation provided by FastAPI.

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - **Teachers**:
     - `POST /teachers/`: Create a new teacher.
     - `GET /teachers/`: Retrieve a list of all teachers.
   - **Students**:
     - `POST /students/`: Create a new student.
     - `GET /students/`: Retrieve a list of all students.
