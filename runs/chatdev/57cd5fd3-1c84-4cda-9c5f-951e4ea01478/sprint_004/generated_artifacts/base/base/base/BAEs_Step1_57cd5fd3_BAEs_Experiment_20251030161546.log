To address the customer's task of creating a simple web application for a Student entity, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a "Website." This would allow us to present the application in a user-friendly manner, enabling users to interact with the Student entity through a web interface. 

What are your thoughts on this modality?

I agree that a "Website" is a great choice for this task. It provides an accessible platform for users to interact with the Student entity and allows for easy deployment and access from any device with a web browser. 

Let's proceed with this modality. What do you think?

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: "  Python *"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via   Python *. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a simple web application for a Student entity using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, we will structure our application into multiple files. The application will also include a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter framework.

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application. It will set up the FastAPI application and the SQLite database.
   - `create_app()`: Initializes the FastAPI app and database.
   - `run()`: Starts the FastAPI server.

2. **models.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy model for the Student entity.
   - `Student`: A class representing the Student entity with a name field.

3. **database.py**: Handles database connection and session management.
   - `get_db()`: A dependency that provides a database session.
   - `init_db()`: Initializes the database schema.

4. **routes.py**: Defines the API endpoints for the Student entity.
   - `create_student()`: Endpoint to create a new student.
   - `get_students()`: Endpoint to retrieve all students.

5. **gui.py**: Implements the GUI for the application using Tkinter.
   - `StudentApp`: A class that creates the GUI for adding and viewing students.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code is mostly well-structured, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `routes.py`, the `Base` class from `database.py` is not imported, which is necessary for the FastAPI application to recognize the `Student` model.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented, but the `create_student` function in `routes.py` does not properly handle the request body as a Pydantic model, which is a best practice in FastAPI.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - While there are comments in the code, the comments could be more descriptive, especially in the `routes.py` file to explain the purpose of each API endpoint.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code has a potential bug in the `create_student` function where it does not validate the input properly. If the `name` is not provided, it should raise an HTTP exception.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is good, and it meets the requirements of creating a Student entity with a name field.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI part (`gui.py`) is functional, but it assumes the FastAPI server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. This should be documented or handled more gracefully.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the handling of the request body in the `create_student` function. Instead of accepting a plain string, it should accept a Pydantic model to ensure proper validation and structure.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Create a Pydantic model for the Student entity in a new file called `schemas.py`:

```python
# schemas.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. Update the `routes.py` to use this model:

```python
# routes.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the new schema

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)  # Use the Pydantic model
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
```

This change ensures that the input is validated and structured properly, improving the robustness of the application.

### Conclusion:
Make these changes to ensure the application meets the requirements and follows best practices. After implementing these suggestions, the application should function correctly and be ready for deployment.

All methods should be implemented: \n   - All methods are implemented, but the create_student function in routes.py does not properly handle the request body as a Pydantic model, which is a best practice in FastAPI.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - While there are comments in the code, the comments could be more descriptive, especially in the routes.py file to explain the purpose of each API endpoint.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The code has a potential bug in the create_student function where it does not validate the input properly. If the name is not provided, it should raise an HTTP exception.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The project structure is good, and it meets the requirements of creating a Student entity with a name field.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement*: \n   - The GUI part (gui.py) is functional, but it assumes the FastAPI server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000. This should be documented or handled more gracefully.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the handling of the request body in the create_student function. Instead of accepting a plain string, it should accept a Pydantic model to ensure proper validation and structure.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Create a Pydantic model for the Student entity in a new file called schemas.py:\n\npython\n# schemas.py\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass StudentCreate(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n\n\n2.

Comments on Codes:
"The provided code is mostly well-structured, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly. Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `routes.py`, the `Base` class from `database.py` is not imported, which is necessary for the FastAPI application to recognize the `Student` model.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented, but the `create_student` function in `routes.py` does not properly handle the request body as a Pydantic model, which is a best practice in FastAPI.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - While there are comments in the code, the comments could be more descriptive, especially in the `routes.py` file to explain the purpose of each API endpoint.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code has a potential bug in the `create_student` function where it does not validate the input properly. If the `name` is not provided, it should raise an HTTP exception.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project structure is good, and it meets the requirements of creating a Student entity with a name field.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI part (`gui.py`) is functional, but it assumes the FastAPI server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. This should be documented or handled more gracefully.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the handling of the request body in the `create_student` function. Instead of accepting a plain string, it should accept a Pydantic model to ensure proper validation and structure.

### Suggested Revision:
1. Create a Pydantic model for the Student entity in a new file called `schemas.py`:

```python
# schemas.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

2. Update the `routes.py` to use this model:

```python
# routes.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the new schema

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)
def create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = Student(name=student.name)  # Use the Pydantic model
    db.add(db_student)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_student)
    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}
```

This change ensures that the input is validated and structured properly, improving the robustness of the application.

### Conclusion:
Make these changes to ensure the application meets the requirements and follows best practices. After implementing these suggestions, the application should function correctly and be ready for deployment."

2. Updated the `create_student` function in `routes.py` to use the Pydantic model and added validation for the name field.
3. Ensured all necessary imports are included and comments are descriptive.

**models.py**
```python
'''
Database models for the application.

from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from database import Base

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

**database.py**
```python
'''
Database connection and session management.
'''
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./students.db"

        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

def init_db() -> None:
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

**routes.py**
```python
'''
API routes for the Student entity.
'''
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models import Student
from database import get_db
from schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the new schema

```

**schemas.py**
```python
'''
Pydantic models for request and response validation.
'''
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StudentCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

### Summary of Changes:
1. Added a new `schemas.py` file with a Pydantic model for input validation.
2. Updated the `create_student` function in `routes.py` to use the Pydantic model and added validation for the name field.
3. Ensured all necessary imports are included and comments are descriptive.

This revised code structure adheres to best practices and meets the requirements specified by the customer.

Here’s a detailed review based on the regulations:\n\n1. All referenced classes should be imported: \n   - In routes.py, the Base class from database.py is not imported, which is necessary for the FastAPI application to recognize the Student model.\n\n2. All methods should be implemented: \n   - All methods are implemented, but the create_student function in routes.py does not properly handle the request body as a Pydantic model, which is a best practice in FastAPI.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: \n   - While there are comments in the code, the comments could be more descriptive, especially in the routes.py file to explain the purpose of each API endpoint.\n\n4. No potential bugs: \n   - The code has a potential bug in the create_student function where it does not validate the input properly. If the name is not provided, it should raise an HTTP exception.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: \n   - The project structure is good, and it meets the requirements of creating a Student entity with a name field.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement*: \n   - The GUI part (gui.py) is functional, but it assumes the FastAPI server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000. This should be documented or handled more gracefully.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue is the handling of the request body in the create_student function. Instead of accepting a plain string, it should accept a Pydantic model to ensure proper validation and structure.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Create a Pydantic model for the Student entity in a new file called schemas.py:\n\npython\n# schemas.py\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass StudentCreate(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n\n\n2. Update the routes.py to use this model:\n\npython\n# routes.py\nfrom fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\nfrom models import Student\nfrom database import get_db\nfrom schemas import StudentCreate  # Import the new schema\n\nrouter = APIRouter()\n\n@router.post("/students/", response_model=dict)\ndef create_student(student: StudentCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    db_student = Student(name=student.name)  # Use the Pydantic model\n    db.add(db_student)\n    db.commit()\n    db.refresh(db_student)\n    return {"id": db_student.id, "name": db_student.name}\n\n\nThis change ensures that the input is validated and structured properly, improving the robustness of the application.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMake these changes to ensure the application meets the requirements and follows best practices. After implementing these suggestions, the application should function correctly and be ready for deployment.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code structure and implementation are mostly correct, but there are a few important issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application operates as intended. Here’s the review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - In `routes.py`, the `StudentCreate` class from `schemas.py` is imported correctly. However, the `Base` class from `database.py` is not imported in `main.py`, which is necessary for initializing the database.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods in the provided code are implemented.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - Most methods have comments, but adding docstrings to all functions would improve clarity.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code appears to be free from syntax errors and potential bugs. However, error handling could be improved in the `add_student` method in `gui.py` to handle non-200 responses more gracefully.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project meets the requirements, but the database initialization function `init_db()` is never called in `main.py`, which is crucial for creating the database schema on startup.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The user can interact with the application, but the lack of database initialization will prevent the application from functioning correctly on the first run.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
The highest priority issue is that the database schema is not created automatically on startup because the `init_db()` function is not called in `main.py`. This will lead to a failure when the application tries to access the database without the required tables.

### Suggestions on Revision:
To fix this, you need to call the `init_db()` function in `main.py` before starting the FastAPI application. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Update `main.py` to include FastAPI and call `init_db()`**:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from routes import router
   from database import init_db

   app = FastAPI()

   # Initialize the database
   init_db()

   # Include the router
   app.include_router(router)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       import uvicorn
       uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
   ```

2. **Ensure that you have the FastAPI server running**: Make sure to run the FastAPI application using the command:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will correctly create the database schema on startup, allowing users to interact with the application as intended.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure the application functions correctly and meets all the regulations outlined. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Import for `schemas.py` in `routes.py`:**
The `schemas.py` file is referenced in `routes.py` for the `StudentCreate` class, but it is not imported. This will lead to a `NameError` when trying to access `StudentCreate`.

### Suggested Revision:
In `routes.py`, add the following import statement at the top of the file:

```python
from schemas import StudentCreate
```

### Additional Suggestions:
1. **Database Initialization in `main.py`:**
   Ensure that the database is initialized when the FastAPI application starts. You can do this by calling `init_db()` in the `main.py` file.

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from database import init_db

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.on_event("startup")
   def startup_event():
       init_db()
   ```

2. **API Response Models:**
   It is a good practice to define response models for your API endpoints. You can create a `StudentResponse` schema in `schemas.py` to define the structure of the response for the student creation and retrieval.

   ```python
   class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
   ```

   Then, update the `create_student` and `get_students` functions in `routes.py` to use this response model.

3. **Error Handling:**
   While the current error handling is adequate, consider adding more specific error messages for different scenarios (e.g., database errors).

4. **Testing the Application:**
   Ensure that you test the application thoroughly after making these changes to confirm that all functionalities work as expected.

### Final Instructions:
1. Add the missing import statement in `routes.py`.
2. Initialize the database in `main.py` during the startup event.
3. Consider implementing response models for better API structure.
4. Test the application after making these changes.

By addressing these points, the application will be more robust and meet the requirements effectively.

- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:

- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found. This typically occurs when the Python installation does not include the Tkinter library, which is used for creating GUI applications. To resolve this issue, we can provide instructions for ensuring that Tkinter is installed properly, rather than modifying the source code itself, as the code is correct.

However, since the task requires modifications based on the error summary, I will include a check to ensure that the application can run without crashing if Tkinter is not available. This can be done by wrapping the Tkinter import in a try-except block.

Here are the modified codes:

You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a simple web application for a Student entity with name field using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

Requirements:
- You must use the best practices for structuring a simple Python web application
- Use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework
- SQLite database for persistence
- Create Student entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
- API should return JSON responses
- Database schema should be created automatically on startup.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error reported indicates that the `tkinter` module is not found. This typically means that the Python installation does not include the Tkinter library, which is required for creating GUI applications. To resolve this issue, we can provide guidance on how to install Tkinter, as it is not a code issue but rather an environment setup issue. 

However, since the task requires modifying the code based on the error summary, I will provide an updated version of the `main.py` file that includes a check for the Tkinter module and a user-friendly message if it is not available.

Here are the modified codes:

except ImportError:

```

### Explanation:
- I wrapped the import statements in a `try` block to catch the `ImportError` if Tkinter is not available.
- If Tkinter is not installed, a message is printed to the console instructing the user to install it.

This modification ensures that the application does not crash due to the missing Tkinter module and provides a clear message to the user about the requirement. 

If you have any further modifications or questions, feel free to ask!

### Explanation:
- I wrapped the import statements in a `try` block to catch the `ImportError` if Tkinter is not available.
- If Tkinter is not installed, a message is printed to the console instructing the user to install it.

This modification ensures that the application does not crash due to the missing Tkinter module and provides a clear message to the user about the requirement. 

If you have any further modifications or questions, feel free to ask!

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
