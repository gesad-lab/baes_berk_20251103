To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be a **Dashboard**, which would allow us to visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time. This could provide insights into course enrollments, student progress, and other relevant metrics.

Alternatively, a **Document** could be useful for providing detailed descriptions of the new relationships, including the database schema changes and migration strategies. This would be more text-focused and might be beneficial for documentation purposes.

We could also consider a **Mind Map** to visually represent the relationships and how they connect, which could be helpful for brainstorming and planning the implementation.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the potential modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic and interactive way to visualize the relationships between students and courses, making it easier to track enrollments and progress. This could be particularly beneficial for stakeholders who want to see real-time data.

On the other hand, a **Document** would serve as a comprehensive reference for the technical aspects of the implementation, ensuring that all details regarding the database schema and migration are clearly outlined. This could be essential for developers and database administrators involved in the project.

The **Mind Map** could be useful for initial brainstorming and conceptualizing the relationships, but it may not provide the depth needed for implementation.

Considering the need for both visualization and detailed documentation, I lean towards the **Dashboard** as it offers a more engaging way to present the relationships while also allowing for real-time updates. 

What do you think? Should we prioritize the Dashboard, or do you see more value in one of the other options?

I agree with your assessment of the **Dashboard** as a strong choice. Its ability to provide real-time visualizations of the relationships between students and courses aligns well with the customer's needs for tracking and managing these connections effectively. 

While the **Document** is important for technical details, the interactive nature of a Dashboard can facilitate better understanding and engagement from stakeholders. It allows for immediate insights and can be designed to highlight key metrics and trends, which is crucial for decision-making.

Given the focus on visualizing relationships and the dynamic nature of the data involved, I believe we should prioritize the **Dashboard** as our product modality for this task.

Shall we finalize our decision?

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few critical areas that need attention to fully satisfy the requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. Here’s the review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Student` and `Course` classes are imported correctly in `routes.py`, but the relationship between them is not established in the models.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The methods in `routes.py` are implemented, but we need to add methods to manage the relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present, but additional comments are needed for the new methods that will be added.

4. **No potential bugs**: There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the relationship management needs to be implemented correctly.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not yet conform fully because the relationship between `Student` and `Course` is not established.

6. **Logic of code**: The logic is mostly sound, but the relationship management is missing.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the relationship between `Student` and `Course` has not been established in the models, and there are no methods to associate students with courses. This is essential to meet the requirement that a student should be able to have courses.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` to include a relationship**:
   - Add a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course` using an association table.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Add methods in `routes.py` to manage course enrollment**:
   - Create a new endpoint to enroll a student in a course.

```python
@router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}/", response_model=dict)
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    
    if not db_student or not db_course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    
    db_student.courses.append(db_course)  # Enroll student in course
    db.commit()
    return {"student_id": db_student.id, "course_id": db_course.id}
```

3. **Update the migration script**:
   - Create the association table in the migration script.

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the Course table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )
    
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )
```

By implementing these changes, the application will fulfill the requirement of allowing students to have courses, and the database schema will support this relationship while preserving existing data.

### Final Instruction:
Please make the above changes to the respective files, and ensure to run the migration script to update the database schema accordingly.

    )
    
    # Create the association table

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few critical areas that need attention to fully satisfy the requirements of adding a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. Here’s the review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The `Student` and `Course` classes are imported correctly in `routes.py`, but the relationship between them is not established in the models.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: The methods in `routes.py` are implemented, but we need to add methods to manage the relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: Comments are present, but additional comments are needed for the new methods that will be added.

4. **No potential bugs**: There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the relationship management needs to be implemented correctly.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not yet conform fully because the relationship between `Student` and `Course` is not established.

6. **Logic of code**: The logic is mostly sound, but the relationship management is missing.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is that the relationship between `Student` and `Course` has not been established in the models, and there are no methods to associate students with courses. This is essential to meet the requirement that a student should be able to have courses.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the `models.py` to include a relationship**:
   - Add a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course` using an association table.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for the many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Add methods in `routes.py` to manage course enrollment**:
   - Create a new endpoint to enroll a student in a course.

```python
@router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}/", response_model=dict)
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    
    if not db_student or not db_course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    
    db_student.courses.append(db_course)  # Enroll student in course
    db.commit()
    return {"student_id": db_student.id, "course_id": db_course.id}
```

3. **Update the migration script**:
   - Create the association table in the migration script.

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the Course table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )
    
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )
```

By implementing these changes, the application will fulfill the requirement of allowing students to have courses, and the database schema will support this relationship while preserving existing data.

### Final Instruction:
Please make the above changes to the respective files, and ensure to run the migration script to update the database schema accordingly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Add methods in routes.py to manage course enrollment:\n   - Create a new endpoint to enroll a student in a course.\n\npython\n@router.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}/", response_model=dict)\ndef enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    db_student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()\n    db_course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n    \n    if not db_student or not db_course:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")\n    \n    db_student.courses.append(db_course)  # Enroll student in course\n    db.commit()\n    return {"student_id": db_student.id, "course_id": db_course.id}\n\n\n3. Update the migration script:\n   - Create the association table in the migration script.\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Create the Course table\n    op.create_table(\n        \'courses\',\n        sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column(\'level\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n    )\n    \n    # Create the association table\n    op.create_table(\n        \'student_courses\',\n        sa.Column(\'student_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column(\'course_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True),\n    )\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will fulfill the requirement of allowing students to have courses, and the database schema will support this relationship while preserving existing data.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease make the above changes to the respective files, and ensure to run the migration script to update the database schema accordingly.'} |

2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided generally adheres to the requirements of adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the implementation is robust and meets the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
**Missing Import for `Base` in `migration_script.py`:**
The `Base` class from `database.py` is not imported in the `migration_script.py`, which is necessary for the migration to work correctly. This could lead to issues when running the migration if the `Base` class is not recognized.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Import the `Base` class in `migration_script.py`:**
   At the top of the `migration_script.py`, add the following import statement:
   ```python
   from database import Base
   ```

2. **Ensure Migration Script is Executed:**
   After making the changes, ensure that the migration script is executed using Alembic to apply the changes to the database schema:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Test the Application:**
   After making the changes, run the application and test the endpoints to ensure that students can be enrolled in courses without any issues.

By addressing the missing import, you will ensure that the migration script functions correctly, allowing the database schema to be updated as required without errors.

### Final Note:
Once the import is added and the migration is executed, the application should function as intended, allowing students to have courses associated with them. 

If you implement this change, the code will be compliant with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

[2025-30-10 16:26:32 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided generally adheres to the requirements of adding a relationship between the Student and Course entities. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure the implementation is robust and meets the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

### Comment with the Highest Priority:
**Missing Import for `Base` in `migration_script.py`:**
The `Base` class from `database.py` is not imported in the `migration_script.py`, which is necessary for the migration to work correctly. This could lead to issues when running the migration if the `Base` class is not recognized.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Import the `Base` class in `migration_script.py`:**
   At the top of the `migration_script.py`, add the following import statement:
   ```python
   from database import Base
   ```

2. **Ensure Migration Script is Executed:**
   After making the changes, ensure that the migration script is executed using Alembic to apply the changes to the database schema:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Test the Application:**
   After making the changes, run the application and test the endpoints to ensure that students can be enrolled in courses without any issues.

By addressing the missing import, you will ensure that the migration script functions correctly, allowing the database schema to be updated as required without errors.

### Final Note:
Once the import is added and the migration is executed, the application should function as intended, allowing students to have courses associated with them. 

If you implement this change, the code will be compliant with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration and the initialization of the database schema. The migration script does not ensure that the existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved when creating the new association table for the many-to-many relationship. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:** The migration script should ensure that existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved and that the new association table is created without data loss.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade()` function in `migration_script.py`** to first check if the `students` and `courses` tables exist and then create the `student_courses` association table without affecting existing data. You may also want to add logic to handle any existing relationships if necessary.

Here’s an example of how you might modify the migration script:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the Course table if it doesn't exist
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )
    
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )
    
    # Optionally, you can add logic here to migrate existing relationships if needed
```

2. **Ensure that the `init_db()` function in `database.py`** is called only once during the application startup to avoid re-creating tables that already exist.

3. **Run the migration script** after making these changes to ensure that the database schema is updated correctly without losing existing data.

By addressing this issue, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements of the customer while maintaining data integrity.

### Conclusion:
Please implement the suggested changes to the migration script and ensure that the database schema is correctly updated without data loss. 

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask.

Modify the upgrade() function in migration_script.py to first check if the students and courses tables exist and then create the student_courses association table without affecting existing data. You may also want to add logic to handle any existing relationships if necessary.\n\nHere’s an example of how you might modify the migration script:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Create the Course table if it doesn't exist\n    op.create_table(\n        'courses',\n        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n    )\n    \n    # Create the association table\n    op.create_table(\n        'student_courses',\n        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),\n    )\n    \n    # Optionally, you can add logic here to migrate existing relationships if needed\n\n\n2. Ensure that the init_db() function in database.py is called only once during the application startup to avoid re-creating tables that already exist.\n\n3. Run the migration script after making these changes to ensure that the database schema is updated correctly without losing existing data.\n\nBy addressing this issue, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements of the customer while maintaining data integrity.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlease implement the suggested changes to the migration script and ensure that the database schema is correctly updated without data loss. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask."} |

The migration script does not ensure that the existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved when creating the new association table for the many-to-many relationship. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration Logic:** The migration script should ensure that existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved and that the new association table is created without data loss.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Modify the `upgrade()` function in `migration_script.py`** to first check if the `students` and `courses` tables exist and then create the `student_courses` association table without affecting existing data. You may also want to add logic to handle any existing relationships if necessary.

Here’s an example of how you might modify the migration script:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the Course table if it doesn't exist
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )
    
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )
    
    # Optionally, you can add logic here to migrate existing relationships if needed
```

2. **Ensure that the `init_db()` function in `database.py`** is called only once during the application startup to avoid re-creating tables that already exist.

3. **Run the migration script** after making these changes to ensure that the database schema is updated correctly without losing existing data.

By addressing this issue, you will ensure that the application meets the requirements of the customer while maintaining data integrity.

### Conclusion:
Please implement the suggested changes to the migration script and ensure that the database schema is correctly updated without data loss. 

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask."

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

# Student-Course Management System

A FastAPI application for managing students and their course enrollments.

## Overview

This application allows users to manage students and their associated courses. It supports creating students and courses, enrolling students in courses, and retrieving lists of students and courses. The application uses a SQLite database for data storage and SQLAlchemy for ORM.

## Main Functions

- **Create Student**: Add a new student with a name and email.
- **Create Course**: Add a new course with a name and level.
- **Enroll Student in Course**: Associate a student with a course.
- **Retrieve Students**: Get a list of all students with their details.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   alembic
   pydantic
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Database Migration

Before running the application, you need to set up the database schema. Use Alembic to apply the migrations:

1. **Run the migration script**:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the FastAPI application, run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the interactive API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   alembic
   pydantic
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Database Migration

Before running the application, you need to set up the database schema. Use Alembic to apply the migrations:

1. **Run the migration script**:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the FastAPI application, run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the interactive API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
