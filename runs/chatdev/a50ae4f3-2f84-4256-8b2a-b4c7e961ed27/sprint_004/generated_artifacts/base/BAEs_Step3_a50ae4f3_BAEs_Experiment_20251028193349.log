To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we should consider the most suitable product modality that can effectively present the information related to the Course entity. 

Given the requirements, we could use a Document format to outline the Course entity's structure and details, or perhaps a Database schema visualization in a Dashboard format to show how the Course entity integrates with existing data.

What are your thoughts on using a Document or a Dashboard for this task?

I believe using a Document format would be beneficial as it allows us to clearly outline the Course entity's structure, including the name and level fields, and provide detailed explanations of the implementation process. It can also serve as a reference for future development and documentation purposes.

However, a Dashboard could provide a more visual representation of how the Course entity fits within the existing database schema, which might be useful for stakeholders who prefer a graphical overview.

Ultimately, I think the Document format would be more straightforward for this specific task. What do you think?

I agree that the Document format would be more straightforward and effective for clearly outlining the Course entity's structure and implementation details. It allows us to provide comprehensive explanations and serves as a solid reference for future development. 

While the Dashboard offers a visual representation, the primary focus here is on documenting the Course entity's specifications and ensuring clarity for the development team. Therefore, I also lean towards the Document format as the best choice for this task. 

Shall we finalize our decision on the Document format?

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The provided code does not currently implement the Course entity as per the customer's requirements. Here is a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The current code does not import any classes related to the Course entity, which is necessary for the task.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods related to creating or managing the Course entity.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods are commented, but there are no comments for methods related to the Course entity since they are missing.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code appears to be free of bugs, but without the Course entity, it does not fulfill the task.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not conform to the user's task as it lacks the Course entity.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current GUI and API are only set up for managing students, not courses.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The highest priority issue is the absence of the Course entity implementation, which is critical to fulfilling the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course model** in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Pydantic schemas for Course** in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Add API endpoints for Course** in `main.py`:
   ```python
   @app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @app.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
   def get_courses(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       return db.query(Course).all()
   ```

4. **Create a migration script for the Course table** in `alembic_migration.py`:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'courses',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
       )

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_table('courses')
   ```

5. **Update the GUI** in `gui.py` to include functionality for creating and viewing courses.

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer's requirements for creating a Course entity and ensure that the existing Student data is preserved during the migration.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the above suggestions to complete the task successfully.

   @app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)

Comments on Codes:
"The provided code does not currently implement the Course entity as per the customer's requirements. Here is a detailed review based on the regulations:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: The current code does not import any classes related to the Course entity, which is necessary for the task.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: There are no methods related to creating or managing the Course entity.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: The existing methods are commented, but there are no comments for methods related to the Course entity since they are missing.

4. **No potential bugs**: The existing code appears to be free of bugs, but without the Course entity, it does not fulfill the task.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: The project does not conform to the user's task as it lacks the Course entity.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: The current GUI and API are only set up for managing students, not courses.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The highest priority issue is the absence of the Course entity implementation, which is critical to fulfilling the customer's requirements.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Create a Course model** in `models.py`:
   ```python
   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Create Pydantic schemas for Course** in `schemas.py`:
   ```python
   class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
       name: str
       level: str

   class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       level: str

       class Config:
           orm_mode = True
   ```

3. **Add API endpoints for Course** in `main.py`:
   ```python
   @app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
       db.add(db_course)
       db.commit()
       db.refresh(db_course)
       return db_course

   @app.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
   def get_courses(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       return db.query(Course).all()
   ```

4. **Create a migration script for the Course table** in `alembic_migration.py`:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       op.create_table(
           'courses',
           sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
           sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
       )

   def downgrade():
       op.drop_table('courses')
   ```

5. **Update the GUI** in `gui.py` to include functionality for creating and viewing courses.

By implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer's requirements for creating a Course entity and ensure that the existing Student data is preserved during the migration.

### Final Instruction:
Please implement the above suggestions to complete the task successfully."

All methods should be implemented: There are no methods related to creating or managing the Course entity.\n\n3. All methods need to have the necessary comments: The existing methods are commented, but there are no comments for methods related to the Course entity since they are missing.\n\n4. No potential bugs: The existing code appears to be free of bugs, but without the Course entity, it does not fulfill the task.\n\n5. The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user: The project does not conform to the user\'s task as it lacks the Course entity.\n\n6. User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement: The current GUI and API are only set up for managing students, not courses.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe highest priority issue is the absence of the Course entity implementation, which is critical to fulfilling the customer\'s requirements.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Create a Course model in models.py:\n   python\n   class Course(Base):\n       __tablename__ = "courses"\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2.

Add API endpoints for Course in main.py:\n   python\n   @app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)\n   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)\n       db.add(db_course)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(db_course)\n       return db_course\n\n   @app.get("/courses/", response_model=list[CourseResponse])\n   def get_courses(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       return db.query(Course).all()\n\n\n4. Create a migration script for the Course table in alembic_migration.py:\n   python\n   def upgrade():\n       op.create_table(\n           \'courses\',\n           sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n           sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n           sa.Column(\'level\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n       )\n\n   def downgrade():\n       op.drop_table(\'courses\')\n\n\n5. Update the GUI in gui.py to include functionality for creating and viewing courses.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the code will meet the customer\'s requirements for creating a Course entity and ensure that the existing Student data is preserved during the migration.\n\n### Final Instruction:\nPlease implement the above suggestions to complete the task successfully.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a few areas that need attention based on the regulations set forth by ChatDev. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **All referenced classes should be imported**: 
   - The code appears to import necessary classes and modules correctly.

2. **All methods should be implemented**: 
   - All methods are implemented as required.

3. **All methods need to have the necessary comments**: 
   - While the methods have some comments, they could be more descriptive. For example, the `create_course` and `get_courses` methods in `main.py` lack detailed comments explaining their functionality.

4. **No potential bugs**: 
   - The code seems to be free of syntax errors and potential bugs at first glance. However, error handling could be improved in the `create_course` function to ensure that any exceptions are caught and handled properly.

5. **The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user**: 
   - The project meets the requirements of creating a Course entity and updating the database schema.

6. **User interaction without losing any feature in the requirement**: 
   - The GUI allows for interaction with both students and courses, fulfilling the requirement.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue is the lack of error handling in the `create_course` function in `main.py`. If an error occurs during the database operation (e.g., a database constraint violation), it will not be caught, and the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.

### Suggested Revision:
To improve the error handling in the `create_course` function, you can wrap the database operations in a try-except block, similar to how it is done in the `create_student` function. Here’s how you can revise the `create_course` function:

```python
@app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    try:
        db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
        db.add(db_course)
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(db_course)
        return db_course
    except Exception as e:
        db.rollback()  # Rollback the session in case of an error
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))  # Raise an HTTP exception with the error message
```

This change ensures that if an error occurs while creating a course, the session is rolled back, and a proper HTTP exception is raised, providing feedback to the user.

### Summary:
Implement the suggested error handling in the `create_course` function to enhance robustness and user experience. 

If you make these changes, the code will be more resilient and user-friendly.

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements outlined in the task. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration and Schema Creation:**
The migration script (`alembic_migration.py`) is correctly set up to create the `courses` table, but it does not explicitly handle the preservation of existing `Student` data during the migration process. While the current implementation does not drop or alter the `students` table, it is crucial to ensure that the migration process is explicitly documented and that any potential future changes do not inadvertently affect existing data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Add Comments to Migration Script:**
   - Include comments in the `alembic_migration.py` file to clarify that the migration does not affect existing data and that the `students` table remains intact.

2. **Ensure Migration Integrity:**
   - Before running the migration, ensure that a backup of the existing database is taken, especially in production environments. This can be mentioned in the comments of the migration script.

3. **Testing Migration:**
   - After implementing the migration, run tests to ensure that both `students` and `courses` can be accessed without any issues. This can be documented in the migration script as a best practice.

### Revised Migration Script Example:
```python
'''
Alembic migration script to add Course table to the database.
This migration does not affect existing Student data.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = 'add_course_table'
down_revision = 'add_email_field_to_student'
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )

def downgrade():
    # Drop the courses table if needed
    op.drop_table('courses')
```

### Conclusion:
By ensuring that the migration process is well-documented and that the integrity of existing data is maintained, we can enhance the robustness of the application. Please implement the suggested changes and ensure that the migration is tested thoroughly.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured and meets the requirements outlined in the task. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations set by ChatDev.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration and Schema Creation:**
The migration script (`alembic_migration.py`) is correctly set up to create the `courses` table, but it does not explicitly handle the preservation of existing `Student` data during the migration process. While the current implementation does not drop or alter the `students` table, it is crucial to ensure that the migration process is explicitly documented and that any potential future changes do not inadvertently affect existing data.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Add Comments to Migration Script:**
   - Include comments in the `alembic_migration.py` file to clarify that the migration does not affect existing data and that the `students` table remains intact.

2. **Ensure Migration Integrity:**
   - Before running the migration, ensure that a backup of the existing database is taken, especially in production environments. This can be mentioned in the comments of the migration script.

3. **Testing Migration:**
   - After implementing the migration, run tests to ensure that both `students` and `courses` can be accessed without any issues. This can be documented in the migration script as a best practice.

### Revised Migration Script Example:
```python
'''
Alembic migration script to add Course table to the database.
This migration does not affect existing Student data.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = 'add_course_table'
down_revision = 'add_email_field_to_student'
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )

def downgrade():
    # Drop the courses table if needed
    op.drop_table('courses')
```

### Conclusion:
By ensuring that the migration process is well-documented and that the integrity of existing data is maintained, we can enhance the robustness of the application. Please implement the suggested changes and ensure that the migration is tested thoroughly.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code and the libraries used in your project, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your Python project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.2
alembic==1.10.3
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Note: Tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to specify in requirements
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to create the API.
- **uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **alembic**: Database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
- **requests**: Library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI for API calls.
- **tkinter**: GUI toolkit for creating the user interface (included with Python, so it doesn't need to be specified).

Make sure to adjust the version numbers if you want to use specific versions or if you have different requirements.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

# Course and Student Management System

A simple application for managing students and courses using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and a FastAPI backend.

## Main Functions

The application allows users to:

- **Manage Students**: Create new students and view existing students.
- **Manage Courses**: Create new courses and view existing courses.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy pydantic requests alembic
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**:
   Ensure that the database schema is up to date by running the Alembic migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Start the FastAPI Server**:
   Run the FastAPI application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. **Run the GUI Application**:
   In a separate terminal, run the GUI:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

## How to Use the Application

### Student Management

1. **Create a Student**:
   - Enter the student's name and email in the respective fields.
   - Click on the "Create Student" button.
   - A success message will appear if the student is created successfully.

2. **View Students**:
   - Click on the "Get Students" button to fetch and display the list of existing students.

### Course Management

1. **Create a Course**:
   - Enter the course name and level in the respective fields.
   - Click on the "Create Course" button.
   - A success message will appear if the course is created successfully.

2. **View Courses**:
   - Click on the "Get Courses" button to fetch and display the list of existing courses.

## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite as the database and includes two main tables:

- **students**: Stores student information (id, name, email).
- **courses**: Stores course information (id, name, level).

## Additional Information

- The application is built using FastAPI for the backend and Tkinter for the GUI.
- The database schema is managed using SQLAlchemy and Alembic for migrations.
- The application is designed to preserve existing student data during database migrations.
