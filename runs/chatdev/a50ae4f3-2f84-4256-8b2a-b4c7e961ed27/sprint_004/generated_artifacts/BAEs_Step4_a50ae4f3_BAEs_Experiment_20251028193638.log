To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be a **Dashboard**, which would allow us to visualize the relationships between students and their courses in real-time. This could provide insights into student enrollment, course popularity, and other metrics.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Document** format, which would allow us to present detailed information about the relationship, including descriptions and examples of how the data is structured.

Another possibility is to use a **Mind Map**, which could visually represent the connections between students and courses, making it easy to understand the relationships at a glance.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the different modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic and interactive way to visualize the relationships between students and courses, allowing for real-time data analysis and insights. This could be particularly useful for administrators and educators who need to monitor student engagement and course offerings.

On the other hand, a **Document** would allow us to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship, including technical details and explanations that could be beneficial for developers and stakeholders involved in the implementation.

The **Mind Map** could serve as a great brainstorming tool to visually outline the relationships, but it may not provide the depth of information that a document or dashboard would.

Considering the customer's needs for both visualization and detailed information, I lean towards the **Dashboard** option for its interactivity and real-time capabilities. However, I see the value in a Document as well.

What do you think? Should we prioritize the Dashboard for its dynamic capabilities, or do you feel a Document would be more appropriate?

I agree that the **Dashboard** offers significant advantages in terms of interactivity and real-time data visualization, which aligns well with the needs of administrators and educators. It allows for immediate insights into student-course relationships, making it a powerful tool for monitoring and decision-making.

While the **Document** provides valuable technical details, it may not engage users in the same way a Dashboard would. Given that our primary goal is to enhance understanding and usability for the end-users, I believe the Dashboard is the more effective choice.

If we decide on the Dashboard, we could also consider creating supplementary documentation to provide the necessary technical details for developers and stakeholders. This way, we can cover both the interactive and informative aspects.

Shall we finalize our choice on the Dashboard?

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided does not fully implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. Specifically, the following points need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Relationship Definition**: The `Student` model does not currently have a relationship defined to link it to the `Course` model. This is essential for allowing a student to have multiple courses.

2. **Database Migration**: The migration script only creates the `courses` table but does not establish a relationship between `students` and `courses`. This should be done using a many-to-many relationship, which requires an association table.

3. **Update Schemas**: The Pydantic schemas do not reflect the new relationship. We need to update the `StudentResponse` schema to include the courses associated with a student.

4. **Update API Endpoints**: The API should allow for adding courses to a student and retrieving a student's courses.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The code lacks a proper many-to-many relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, which is essential for fulfilling the requirement that a student can have multiple courses.**

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Update `models.py`**:
   - Define an association table for the many-to-many relationship.
   - Update the `Student` and `Course` models to include this relationship.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update `schemas.py`**:
   - Modify the `StudentResponse` schema to include a list of courses.

```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: list[CourseResponse]  # Add this line
```

3. **Update `main.py`**:
   - Implement API endpoints to add courses to a student and retrieve a student's courses.

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def add_course_to_student(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": "Course added to student successfully"}

@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return student.courses
```

4. **Update the migration script** to create the association table.

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )
```

### Instructions:
1. Implement the changes in the `models.py`, `schemas.py`, `main.py`, and `alembic_migration.py` files as described above.
2. Run the migration to update the database schema.
3. Test the application to ensure that students can be associated with multiple courses and that the API functions as expected.

By addressing these points, the application will meet the requirements specified by the customer.

[2025-28-10 19:37:15 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 The code provided does not fully implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. Specifically, the following points need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Relationship Definition**: The `Student` model does not currently have a relationship defined to link it to the `Course` model. This is essential for allowing a student to have multiple courses.

2. **Database Migration**: The migration script only creates the `courses` table but does not establish a relationship between `students` and `courses`. This should be done using a many-to-many relationship, which requires an association table.

3. **Update Schemas**: The Pydantic schemas do not reflect the new relationship. We need to update the `StudentResponse` schema to include the courses associated with a student.

4. **Update API Endpoints**: The API should allow for adding courses to a student and retrieving a student's courses.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided does not fully implement the required relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. Specifically, the following points need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Relationship Definition**: The `Student` model does not currently have a relationship defined to link it to the `Course` model. This is essential for allowing a student to have multiple courses.

2. **Database Migration**: The migration script only creates the `courses` table but does not establish a relationship between `students` and `courses`. This should be done using a many-to-many relationship, which requires an association table.

3. **Update Schemas**: The Pydantic schemas do not reflect the new relationship. We need to update the `StudentResponse` schema to include the courses associated with a student.

4. **Update API Endpoints**: The API should allow for adding courses to a student and retrieving a student's courses.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The code lacks a proper many-to-many relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, which is essential for fulfilling the requirement that a student can have multiple courses.**

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Update `models.py`**:
   - Define an association table for the many-to-many relationship.
   - Update the `Student` and `Course` models to include this relationship.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

# Association table for many-to-many relationship
student_courses = Table(
    'student_courses',
    Base.metadata,
    Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
    Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = "students"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False)
    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
```

2. **Update `schemas.py`**:
   - Modify the `StudentResponse` schema to include a list of courses.

```python
class StudentResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    courses: list[CourseResponse]  # Add this line
```

3. **Update `main.py`**:
   - Implement API endpoints to add courses to a student and retrieve a student's courses.

```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def add_course_to_student(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": "Course added to student successfully"}

@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])
def get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    if not student:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")
    return student.courses
```

4. **Update the migration script** to create the association table.

```python
def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )
```

### Instructions:
1. Implement the changes in the `models.py`, `schemas.py`, `main.py`, and `alembic_migration.py` files as described above.
2. Run the migration to update the database schema.
3. Test the application to ensure that students can be associated with multiple courses and that the API functions as expected.

By addressing these points, the application will meet the requirements specified by the customer."

'', 'comments': 'The code provided does not fully implement the required relationship between the Student and Course entities. Specifically, the following points need to be addressed:\n\n1. Missing Relationship Definition: The Student model does not currently have a relationship defined to link it to the Course model. This is essential for allowing a student to have multiple courses.\n\n2. Database Migration: The migration script only creates the courses table but does not establish a relationship between students and courses. This should be done using a many-to-many relationship, which requires an association table.\n\n3. Update Schemas: The Pydantic schemas do not reflect the new relationship. We need to update the StudentResponse schema to include the courses associated with a student.\n\n4. Update API Endpoints: The API should allow for adding courses to a student and retrieving a student\'s courses.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe code lacks a proper many-to-many relationship between the Student and Course entities, which is essential for fulfilling the requirement that a student can have multiple courses.\n\n### Suggested Revisions:\n1. Update models.py:\n   - Define an association table for the many-to-many relationship.\n   - Update the Student and Course models to include this relationship.\n\npython\nfrom sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n\n# Association table for many-to-many relationship\nstudent_courses = Table(\n    \'student_courses\',\n    Base.metadata,\n    Column(\'student_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n    Column(\'course_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n)\n\nclass Student(Base):\n    __tablename__ = "students"\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")\n\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = "courses"\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n\n\n2. Update schemas.py:\n   - Modify the StudentResponse schema to include a list of courses.\n\npython\nclass StudentResponse(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    email: str\n    courses: list[CourseResponse]  # Add this line\n\n\n3. Update main.py:\n   - Implement API endpoints to add courses to a student and retrieve a student\'s courses.\n\npython\n@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")\ndef add_course_to_student(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()\n    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n    if not student or not course:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")\n    student.courses.append(course)\n    db.commit()\n    return {"message": "Course added to student successfully"}\n\n@app.get("/students/{student_id}/courses", response_model=list[CourseResponse])\ndef get_student_courses(student_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()\n    if not student:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student not found")\n    return student.courses\n\n\n4.

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the customer's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `create_course` method in `main.py` does not handle potential errors when adding a course to the database. If the course creation fails, it should rollback the transaction and return an appropriate error message.**

### Suggested Revision:
To fix this issue, you should wrap the course creation logic in a try-except block to handle exceptions properly. Here’s how you can modify the `create_course` method:

```python
@app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    try:
        db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
        db.add(db_course)
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(db_course)
        return db_course
    except Exception as e:
        db.rollback()  # Rollback the transaction in case of error
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))  # Return an error message
```

### Additional Suggestions:
1. **Ensure that the database connection is properly managed**: Although the current implementation seems fine, always double-check that the database connection is closed properly in all scenarios.
2. **Add validation for course names and levels**: Consider adding validation to ensure that course names and levels are not empty or invalid.

By implementing these changes, the code will be more robust and user-friendly, ensuring that users can interact with the software without encountering unhandled exceptions.

If you make these adjustments, the code will be in line with the requirements and regulations set forth by ChatDev.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the software operates correctly and meets the user's requirements.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The `create_course` method in `main.py` does not handle potential exceptions that may arise during the database commit operation. This could lead to unhandled exceptions and a poor user experience. Additionally, the `add_course_to_student` method should also handle the case where the course is already associated with the student to prevent duplicate entries.**

### Suggested Revisions:
1. **Update the `create_course` method to handle exceptions:**
   ```python
   @app.post("/courses/", response_model=CourseResponse)
   def create_course(course: CourseCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       try:
           db_course = Course(name=course.name, level=course.level)
           db.add(db_course)
           db.commit()
           db.refresh(db_course)
           return db_course
       except Exception as e:
           db.rollback()  # Rollback in case of error
           raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
   ```

2. **Update the `add_course_to_student` method to check for existing associations:**
   ```python
   @app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
   def add_course_to_student(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
       student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
       course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
       if not student or not course:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
       if course in student.courses:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Course already added to student")
       student.courses.append(course)
       db.commit()
       return {"message": "Course added to student successfully"}
   ```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added exception handling in the `create_course` method to ensure that any errors during the database commit are managed properly.
- Implemented a check in the `add_course_to_student` method to prevent adding the same course to a student multiple times.

These changes will enhance the robustness of the application and improve the user experience by preventing potential errors and ensuring that the application behaves as expected.

### Final Note:
After implementing these changes, please test the application thoroughly to ensure that all functionalities work as intended and that no features are lost in the process.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code, the project uses FastAPI for the web framework, SQLAlchemy for database interactions, and Pydantic for data validation. Additionally, since the project uses Alembic for database migrations, we will include that as well. Here’s a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.95.0
uvicorn==0.22.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.47
pydantic==1.10.7
alembic==1.10.2
requests==2.28.1
tkinter  # Note: Tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to install separately
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: The ORM used for database interactions.
- **pydantic**: Used for data validation and serialization.
- **alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
- **requests**: Used for making HTTP requests in the GUI application.
- **tkinter**: The GUI toolkit used for the dashboard (included with Python, no installation needed).

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project requirements or the latest stable versions available at the time of installation.

For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

# Student and Course Management System

This application allows users to manage students and their associated courses through a simple graphical user interface (GUI). Users can create students and courses, add courses to students, and view the courses associated with each student.

## Main Functions

- **Create Student**: Allows users to add a new student by providing their name and email.
- **Get Students**: Fetches and displays a list of all students in the system.
- **Create Course**: Enables users to create a new course by specifying its name and level.
- **Get Courses**: Retrieves and displays a list of all courses available in the system.
- **Add Course to Student**: Associates a specified course with a student.
- **Get Student Courses**: Displays all courses associated with a specific student.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to set up your environment and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have `pip` installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy pydantic requests
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   Ensure you have SQLite installed (it comes with Python). The application will create a database file named `students.db` automatically.

5. **Run the Application**:
   Start the FastAPI server by running:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. **Launch the GUI**:
   In another terminal, run:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

## How to Use the Application
