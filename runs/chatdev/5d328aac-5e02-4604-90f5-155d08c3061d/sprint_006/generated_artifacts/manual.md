# ChatDev Course Management System

Welcome to the ChatDev Course Management System! This software allows you to manage courses, students, and teachers efficiently. You can create, read, and manage relationships between these entities through a RESTful API built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.

## Main Functions

- **Manage Students**: Create, read, and associate students with courses.
- **Manage Courses**: Create, read, and associate courses with teachers.
- **Manage Teachers**: Create and read teacher information.
- **Relationships**: Establish relationships between courses and teachers, as well as students and courses.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   sqlalchemy
   alembic
   pydantic
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Database Setup

1. **Initialize the Database**:
   The database will be automatically created when you start the application. However, you can also run the migration scripts manually using Alembic to ensure your database schema is up to date.

   To run migrations, use:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## How to Use the API

The API is built using FastAPI and can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000`. You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API.

### Endpoints

- **Students**:
  - `POST /students/`: Create a new student.
  - `GET /students/`: Retrieve a list of all students.

- **Courses**:
  - `POST /courses/`: Create a new course (requires `teacher_id`).
  - `GET /courses/`: Retrieve a list of all courses.

- **Teachers**:
  - `POST /teachers/`: Create a new teacher.
  - `GET /teachers/`: Retrieve a list of all teachers.

### Example Requests

1. **Create a Teacher**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/teachers/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}'
   ```

2. **Create a Course**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/courses/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Mathematics", "level": "Beginner", "teacher_id": 1}'
   ```

3. **Create a Student**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/students/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane.smith@example.com"}'
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000` with automatic reloading enabled.

## Conclusion

This Course Management System provides a robust framework for managing educational entities and their relationships. For more detailed information on each endpoint and additional functionalities, please refer to the API documentation generated by FastAPI at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

Happy coding!
