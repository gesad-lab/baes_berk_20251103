# Student Management Web Application

A simple web application for managing student records using Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.

## Main Functions

This application allows users to:
- Add a new student by providing their name.
- View the response confirming the addition of the student.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to set up your environment and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Python 3.11+**: Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   Use pip to install FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and an ASGI server (like uvicorn) to run the application.
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy uvicorn
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the FastAPI Server**:
   Navigate to the directory containing your `main.py` file and run:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   This will start the FastAPI server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Access the API Documentation**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to view the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI.

## Using the Application

### Adding a Student

1. **Open the GUI**:
   The GUI will launch automatically when you run `main.py`. 

2. **Enter Student Name**:
   In the GUI, enter the student's name in the provided text field.

3. **Submit**:
   Click the "Add Student" button. If the operation is successful, you will see a confirmation message in the output area.

### Example of Adding a Student

- Enter "John Doe" in the name field and click "Add Student".
- The output will display: `Added Student: John Doe`.

## Database

The application uses SQLite for persistence. The database schema will be created automatically on startup, and a file named `students.db` will be generated in the same directory.

## Conclusion

This simple web application provides a straightforward way to manage student records. You can extend its functionality by adding more fields or features as needed.
