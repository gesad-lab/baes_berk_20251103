To address the customer's task of creating a Course entity, we need to consider the best product modality that can effectively present the information related to the Course entity, including its name and level fields. 

I believe a Database or Application modality could be suitable since it allows for structured data management and interaction. However, we should also consider if a Dashboard could provide a visual representation of the Course data, making it easier for users to interact with and understand the information.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I agree that a Database or Application modality would be effective for managing the Course entity and its data. The Database would allow for structured storage and retrieval of Course information, while an Application could provide a user-friendly interface for interaction.

However, I also see the value in a Dashboard, as it could visually represent the Course data and allow users to easily navigate and analyze the information. 

Ultimately, it may depend on the customer's specific needs and how they intend to use the Course entity. 

What do you think about prioritizing the Database or Application for the core functionality, while also considering a Dashboard for visualization?

I think prioritizing the Database or Application for core functionality is a solid approach, as it ensures we have a robust system for managing the Course entity and its data. This will allow us to meet the customer's requirements effectively.

Incorporating a Dashboard for visualization can enhance the user experience by providing insights into the Course data, making it easier for users to analyze and interact with the information. This dual approach could cater to both the functional and visual aspects of the product.

Shall we agree on this combined approach of focusing on the Database or Application as the primary modality, with the Dashboard as an additional feature for visualization?

I completely agree with this combined approach. Focusing on the Database or Application as the primary modality will ensure we have a strong foundation for managing the Course entity, while adding a Dashboard for visualization will enhance user engagement and data analysis.

This strategy allows us to meet the customer's requirements comprehensively and provides a well-rounded solution.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)

### Code Review

1. **Importing Required Classes**: The necessary classes from `schemas.py`, `models.py`, and `database.py` are not imported in the relevant files where they are needed. This will lead to `NameError` when trying to use these classes.

2. **Method Implementation**: The migration scripts do not implement the logic to create the new `Course` entity and its corresponding table. The existing migration scripts only handle the addition of the `email` field to the `students` table.

3. **Commenting**: While most methods have comments, the new methods that need to be added for the `Course` entity lack comments explaining their purpose.

4. **Potential Bugs**: There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the migration scripts need to be updated to ensure they create the `Course` table correctly.

5. **Conformance to User Requirements**: The current code does not fulfill the user's requirement to create a `Course` entity with `name` and `level` fields. This is a critical oversight.

6. **User Interaction**: The GUI does not provide any functionality to interact with the `Course` entity, which is required by the user.

### Highest Priority Comment

The highest priority issue is the **lack of implementation for the `Course` entity and its corresponding database migration**. This is essential to meet the user's requirements.

### Suggested Revisions

1. **Create a Course Model**: Add a new model for the `Course` entity in `models.py`.

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

2. **Create a Course Schema**: Add a new schema for the `Course` entity in `schemas.py`.

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

3. **Update Migration Script**: Create a new migration script to add the `courses` table.

```python
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

revision = 'xxxxxx'  # Replace with your revision ID
down_revision = None  # Replace with your down revision ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )

def downgrade():
    # Drop the courses table
    op.drop_table('courses')
```

4. **Update GUI**: Modify the `main.py` to include functionality for adding courses.

```python
# Add necessary imports for Course
class CourseApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Course Management")
        self.label = tk.Label(root, text="Course Name:")
        self.label.pack()
        self.entry = tk.Entry(root)
        self.entry.pack()
        self.level_label = tk.Label(root, text="Course Level:")
        self.level_label.pack()
        self.level_entry = tk.Entry(root)
        self.level_entry.pack()
        self.submit_button = tk.Button(root, text="Add Course", command=self.add_course)
        self.submit_button.pack()
        self.output = tk.Text(root, height=10, width=30)
        self.output.pack()

    def add_course(self):
        '''
        Sends a request to add a new course to the API.
        '''
        name = self.entry.get()
        level = self.level_entry.get()
        response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/", json={"name": name, "level": level})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.output.insert(tk.END, f"Added Course: {response.json()['name']} with Level: {response.json()['level']}\n")
        else:
            self.output.insert(tk.END, "Failed to add course.\n")
```

### Conclusion

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements for creating and managing `Course` entities while preserving existing `Student` data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the software is operable as intended.

Comments on Codes:
"### Code Review

1. **Importing Required Classes**: The necessary classes from `schemas.py`, `models.py`, and `database.py` are not imported in the relevant files where they are needed. This will lead to `NameError` when trying to use these classes.

2. **Method Implementation**: The migration scripts do not implement the logic to create the new `Course` entity and its corresponding table. The existing migration scripts only handle the addition of the `email` field to the `students` table.

3. **Commenting**: While most methods have comments, the new methods that need to be added for the `Course` entity lack comments explaining their purpose.

4. **Potential Bugs**: There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the migration scripts need to be updated to ensure they create the `Course` table correctly.

5. **Conformance to User Requirements**: The current code does not fulfill the user's requirement to create a `Course` entity with `name` and `level` fields. This is a critical oversight.

6. **User Interaction**: The GUI does not provide any functionality to interact with the `Course` entity, which is required by the user.

### Highest Priority Comment

The highest priority issue is the **lack of implementation for the `Course` entity and its corresponding database migration**. This is essential to meet the user's requirements.

### Suggested Revisions

1. **Create a Course Model**: Add a new model for the `Course` entity in `models.py`.

```python
class Course(Base):
    __tablename__ = "courses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    level = Column(String, nullable=False)
```

2. **Create a Course Schema**: Add a new schema for the `Course` entity in `schemas.py`.

```python
class CourseCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    level: str

class CourseResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    level: str

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

3. **Update Migration Script**: Create a new migration script to add the `courses` table.

```python
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

revision = 'xxxxxx'  # Replace with your revision ID
down_revision = None  # Replace with your down revision ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None

def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )

def downgrade():
    # Drop the courses table
    op.drop_table('courses')
```

4. **Update GUI**: Modify the `main.py` to include functionality for adding courses.

```python
# Add necessary imports for Course
class CourseApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Course Management")
        self.label = tk.Label(root, text="Course Name:")
        self.label.pack()
        self.entry = tk.Entry(root)
        self.entry.pack()
        self.level_label = tk.Label(root, text="Course Level:")
        self.level_label.pack()
        self.level_entry = tk.Entry(root)
        self.level_entry.pack()
        self.submit_button = tk.Button(root, text="Add Course", command=self.add_course)
        self.submit_button.pack()
        self.output = tk.Text(root, height=10, width=30)
        self.output.pack()

    def add_course(self):
        '''
        Sends a request to add a new course to the API.
        '''
        name = self.entry.get()
        level = self.level_entry.get()
        response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/", json={"name": name, "level": level})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.output.insert(tk.END, f"Added Course: {response.json()['name']} with Level: {response.json()['level']}\n")
        else:
            self.output.insert(tk.END, "Failed to add course.\n")
```

### Conclusion

By implementing these changes, the application will meet the user's requirements for creating and managing `Course` entities while preserving existing `Student` data. 

Please proceed with these revisions to ensure the software is operable as intended."

Importing Required Classes: The necessary classes from schemas.py, models.py, and database.py are not imported in the relevant files where they are needed. This will lead to NameError when trying to use these classes.\n\n2. Method Implementation: The migration scripts do not implement the logic to create the new Course entity and its corresponding table. The existing migration scripts only handle the addition of the email field to the students table.\n\n3. Commenting: While most methods have comments, the new methods that need to be added for the Course entity lack comments explaining their purpose.\n\n4. Potential Bugs: There are no apparent bugs in the existing code, but the migration scripts need to be updated to ensure they create the Course table correctly.\n\n5. Conformance to User Requirements: The current code does not fulfill the user\'s requirement to create a Course entity with name and level fields. This is a critical oversight.\n\n6. User Interaction: The GUI does not provide any functionality to interact with the Course entity, which is required by the user.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment\n\nThe highest priority issue is the lack of implementation for the Course entity and its corresponding database migration. This is essential to meet the user\'s requirements.\n\n### Suggested Revisions\n\n1. Create a Course Model: Add a new model for the Course entity in models.py.\n\npython\nclass Course(Base):\n    __tablename__ = "courses"\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n    name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n\n\n2.

Update Migration Script: Create a new migration script to add the courses table.\n\npython\nfrom alembic import op\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\n\nrevision = \'xxxxxx\'  # Replace with your revision ID\ndown_revision = None  # Replace with your down revision ID\nbranch_labels = None\ndepends_on = None\n\ndef upgrade():\n    # Create the courses table\n    op.create_table(\n        \'courses\',\n        sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column(\'level\', sa.String(), nullable=False)\n    )\n\ndef downgrade():\n    # Drop the courses table\n    op.drop_table(\'courses\')\n\n\n4.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the overall functionality. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration for Course Table:**
The migration script for creating the `courses` table (`migration_script.py`) has a `down_revision` set to `None`, which is incorrect. It should reference the last migration that was applied to ensure proper migration order. Additionally, the `revision` identifier should be unique and not set to `xxxxxx`.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `migration_script.py`:**
   - Set the `down_revision` to the correct previous migration ID (for example, the ID of the migration that added the email column).
   - Assign a unique identifier to the `revision`.

Here’s how you can modify the `migration_script.py`:

```python
'''
Migration script to create courses table.
'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = 'unique_revision_id'  # Replace with a unique revision ID
down_revision = 'previous_revision_id'  # Replace with the last applied migration ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None
def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )
def downgrade():
    # Drop the courses table
    op.drop_table('courses')
```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that the `CourseApp` class in `main.py` has proper error handling for the API requests to provide more informative feedback to the user.
- Consider adding validation for the `name` and `level` fields in the `CourseCreate` schema to ensure they meet any specific criteria (e.g., length, format).

By implementing these changes, the code will be more robust and compliant with the requirements set forth by the customer.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is mostly well-structured, but there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance the overall functionality. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration for Course Table:**
The migration script for creating the `courses` table (`migration_script.py`) has a `down_revision` set to `None`, which is incorrect. It should reference the last migration that was applied to ensure proper migration order. Additionally, the `revision` identifier should be unique and not set to `xxxxxx`.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Update the `migration_script.py`:**
   - Set the `down_revision` to the correct previous migration ID (for example, the ID of the migration that added the email column).
   - Assign a unique identifier to the `revision`.

Here’s how you can modify the `migration_script.py`:

```python
'''

'''
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = 'unique_revision_id'  # Replace with a unique revision ID
down_revision = 'previous_revision_id'  # Replace with the last applied migration ID
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None
def upgrade():
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),

    )
def downgrade():

```

### Additional Suggestions:
- Ensure that the `CourseApp` class in `main.py` has proper error handling for the API requests to provide more informative feedback to the user.
- Consider adding validation for the `name` and `level` fields in the `CourseCreate` schema to ensure they meet any specific criteria (e.g., length, format).

By implementing these changes, the code will be more robust and compliant with the requirements set forth by the customer.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, there are a few areas that need attention to ensure compliance with the regulations and to enhance functionality. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Database Migration for Course Entity:**
The migration script for creating the `courses` table is present, but it lacks a proper revision ID and down_revision reference. This could lead to issues when applying migrations, especially if there are multiple migrations in the future. Additionally, the migration script for adding the email column to the students table should ensure that existing data is preserved by making the email column nullable initially, which is already done in the migration.py script.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Update the Migration Script for Courses:**
   - Ensure that the `revision` and `down_revision` identifiers are correctly set in the `migration_script.py` for the courses table. Replace `unique_revision_id` and `previous_revision_id` with actual identifiers.
   
   ```python
   # migration_script.py
   revision = '20231001_create_courses_table'  # Example revision ID
   down_revision = 'xxxxxx'  # Replace with the last applied migration ID
   ```

2. **Ensure Consistency in Migration Scripts:**
   - Make sure that the migration for adding the email column to the students table is consistent with the course migration. If the email column is to be required, ensure that the application logic handles existing records appropriately.

3. **Import Statements:**
   - Ensure that all necessary classes are imported in the `main.py` file for both `StudentApp` and `CourseApp`. This includes any necessary imports for the requests library and any other dependencies.

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Implement unit tests for the Course entity creation and ensure that the API endpoints are functioning as expected. This will help catch any potential bugs before deployment.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Add comments to the migration scripts explaining the purpose of each operation, especially for future maintainers.

### Final Note:
After making these adjustments, ensure to run the migrations and test the application thoroughly to confirm that all features are functioning as intended and that no data is lost during the migration process.

If you implement these suggestions, the code will be more robust and ready for deployment.

revision = 'xxxxxx'  # Replace with your revision ID
down_revision = None  # Replace with your down revision ID
branch_labels = None

def upgrade():

These modifications ensure that the Course entity is created with the required fields, the database schema is updated accordingly, and existing Student data is preserved during migration.

Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code snippets and the libraries used, here is a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the necessary dependencies for your project:

```plaintext
fastapi==0.68.0
uvicorn==0.15.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.27
alembic==1.7.7
pydantic==1.8.2
requests==2.26.0
tkinter  # Note: Tkinter is included with Python standard library, no need to specify in requirements
```

### Explanation of Dependencies:
- **fastapi**: The web framework used for building APIs.
- **uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **sqlalchemy**: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python.
- **alembic**: Database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
- **pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **requests**: Library for making HTTP requests, used in the GUI to interact with the API.
- **tkinter**: GUI toolkit for Python, typically included with Python installations, so it doesn't need to be specified.

Make sure to adjust the versions according to your project's compatibility and requirements.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

[2025-31-10 00:11:28 INFO] Chief Product Officer: **Chief Product Officer<->Chief Executive Officer on : Manual, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a Course entity with name and level fields.

Requirements:
- Create Course entity with only:
  - name (string, required)
  - level (string, required)
- Update the database schema to include the new Course table
- Database migration should preserve existing Student data.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/course-management-system.git
cd course-management-system
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to include the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
sqlalchemy
pydantic
alembic
requests
tkinter
```

### Step 4: Run Database Migrations

Before running the application, you need to apply the database migrations to set up the necessary tables.

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Start the Application**: Run the main application file to launch the GUI.

```bash
python main.py
```

2. **Adding Students**:
   - Enter the student's name and email in the respective fields.
   - Click the "Add Student" button to save the information.
   - The application will display a confirmation message if the student is added successfully.

3. **Adding Courses**:
   - Enter the course name and level in the respective fields.
   - Click the "Add Course" button to save the information.
   - The application will display a confirmation message if the course is added successfully.

4. **Viewing Information**: The application will show feedback messages in the output area for both student and course additions.

## Database Structure

The application uses a SQLite database with the following tables:

- **students**: Stores student information (id, name, email).
- **courses**: Stores course information (id, name, level).

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the database file (`students.db`) is created in the project directory after running the migrations.
- The application is designed to preserve existing student data during migrations.
