To address the customer's task of adding a course relationship to the Student entity, we need to consider how best to present this information. 

One option could be to use a **Dashboard**. This would allow us to visualize the relationships between students and their courses dynamically, providing real-time insights into enrollment, course progress, and other relevant metrics.

Alternatively, we could consider a **Document** format, which would allow us to provide detailed descriptions of the relationships, including any necessary documentation on how the database schema has been updated.

Another possibility is to create a **Website** that could serve as an interactive platform for users to explore the relationships between students and courses, offering a more engaging experience.

What are your thoughts on these options?

I appreciate your insights on the various modalities. 

A **Dashboard** would indeed provide a dynamic and interactive way to visualize the relationships between students and courses, which could be very beneficial for users looking to analyze data in real-time. 

On the other hand, a **Document** would be useful for providing comprehensive details and instructions, ensuring that all technical aspects are clearly communicated.

The **Website** option could also be engaging, allowing users to interact with the data in a more user-friendly manner.

Considering the nature of the task, I lean towards the **Dashboard** as it aligns well with the need for real-time insights and visual representation of the relationships. However, I see the value in the other options as well.

What do you think? Should we prioritize the Dashboard, or do you have a preference for another modality?

I agree that the **Dashboard** is an excellent choice for this task. It not only allows for real-time visualization of the relationships between students and courses but also provides an interactive experience that can help users better understand the data. 

While the Document and Website options have their merits, the dynamic nature of a Dashboard aligns perfectly with the customer's needs for monitoring and analyzing course relationships effectively. 

Given our shared perspective on the value of the Dashboard, I believe we should proceed with it as our chosen product modality. 

Are you ready to finalize this decision?

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided has a solid foundation, but it lacks the implementation of the relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, which is a critical requirement of the task. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Implementation**: The `Student` entity should have a relationship with the `Course` entity to allow students to enroll in courses. This relationship is typically represented as a many-to-many relationship, which requires an association table.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create an Association Table**: Add a new table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

2. **Update the `models.py`**:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
   from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

   # Association table for the many-to-many relationship
   student_courses = Table(
       'student_courses',
       Base.metadata,
       Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
       Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
   )

   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = "students"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
   ```

3. **Update the Database Migration**: Modify the `alembic_migration.py` to create the `student_courses` association table.
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       # Existing upgrade code...
       # Create the association table
       op.create_table(
           'student_courses',
           sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
       )
   ```

4. **Update the API Endpoints**: Implement endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve courses for a student.

### Example Endpoint for Enrolling a Student in a Course:
```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Enroll a student in a course.
    '''
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing the above changes, you will fulfill the requirement of establishing a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, allowing students to have courses. 

Please proceed with these modifications to ensure the application meets the customer's needs effectively.

       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
   ```

3. **Update the Database Migration**: Modify the `alembic_migration.py` to create the `student_courses` association table.
   ```python

       # Create the association table
       op.create_table(
           'student_courses',

           sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
       )
   ```

### Example Endpoint for Enrolling a Student in a Course:
```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Enroll a student in a course.
    '''
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing the above changes, you will fulfill the requirement of establishing a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, allowing students to have courses. 

Please proceed with these modifications to ensure the application meets the customer's needs effectively.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided has a solid foundation, but it lacks the implementation of the relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, which is a critical requirement of the task. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Missing Relationship Implementation**: The `Student` entity should have a relationship with the `Course` entity to allow students to enroll in courses. This relationship is typically represented as a many-to-many relationship, which requires an association table.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Create an Association Table**: Add a new table to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`.

2. **Update the `models.py`**:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey
   from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

   # Association table for the many-to-many relationship
   student_courses = Table(
       'student_courses',
       Base.metadata,
       Column('student_id', Integer, ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
       Column('course_id', Integer, ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True)
   )

   class Student(Base):
       __tablename__ = "students"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       email = Column(String, nullable=False)
       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")

   class Course(Base):
       __tablename__ = "courses"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)
       level = Column(String, nullable=False)
       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")
   ```

3. **Update the Database Migration**: Modify the `alembic_migration.py` to create the `student_courses` association table.
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       # Existing upgrade code...
       # Create the association table
       op.create_table(
           'student_courses',
           sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
           sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
       )
   ```

4. **Update the API Endpoints**: Implement endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve courses for a student.

### Example Endpoint for Enrolling a Student in a Course:
```python
@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")
def enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    '''
    Enroll a student in a course.
    '''
    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()
    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()
    if not student or not course:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")
    
    student.courses.append(course)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing the above changes, you will fulfill the requirement of establishing a relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, allowing students to have courses. 

Please proceed with these modifications to ensure the application meets the customer's needs effectively."

[2025-31-10 15:15:23 INFO] Programmer: **Programmer<->Code Reviewer on : CodeReviewModification, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary changes to implement the relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities, including the creation of an association table and updates to the migration script and API endpoints.

This relationship is typically represented as a many-to-many relationship, which requires an association table.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Create an Association Table: Add a new table to represent the many-to-many relationship between Student and Course.\n\n2. Update the models.py:\n   python\n   from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n\n   # Association table for the many-to-many relationship\n   student_courses = Table(\n       \'student_courses\',\n       Base.metadata,\n       Column(\'student_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n       Column(\'course_id\', Integer, ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True)\n   )\n\n   class Student(Base):\n       __tablename__ = "students"\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       email = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       courses = relationship("Course", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="students")\n\n   class Course(Base):\n       __tablename__ = "courses"\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n       name = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       level = Column(String, nullable=False)\n       students = relationship("Student", secondary=student_courses, back_populates="courses")\n\n\n3. Update the Database Migration: Modify the alembic_migration.py to create the student_courses association table.\n   python\n   def upgrade():\n       # Existing upgrade code...\n       # Create the association table\n       op.create_table(\n           \'student_courses\',\n           sa.Column(\'student_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n           sa.Column(\'course_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True),\n       )\n\n\n4. Update the API Endpoints: Implement endpoints to enroll students in courses and retrieve courses for a student.\n\n### Example Endpoint for Enrolling a Student in a Course:\npython\n@app.post("/students/{student_id}/courses/{course_id}")\ndef enroll_student_in_course(student_id: int, course_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n    \'\'\'\n    Enroll a student in a course.\n    \'\'\'\n    student = db.query(Student).filter(Student.id == student_id).first()\n    course = db.query(Course).filter(Course.id == course_id).first()\n    if not student or not course:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Student or Course not found")\n    \n    student.courses.append(course)\n    db.commit()\n    return {"message": "Student enrolled in course successfully"}\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy implementing the above changes, you will fulfill the requirement of establishing a relationship between the Student and Course entities, allowing students to have courses. \n\nPlease proceed with these modifications to ensure the application meets the customer\'s needs effectively.'} |

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration process. The migration script does not handle the case where the `students` table might already contain data when the new `email` column is added. This could lead to potential data integrity issues if the migration is run on an existing database without proper handling of existing records.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The migration script should ensure that existing records in the `students` table are handled correctly when adding the new `email` column. Specifically, the script should set a default value for the `email` field for existing records before altering the column to be non-nullable.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. Modify the `upgrade()` function in `alembic_migration.py` to ensure that existing records are updated with a default value for the `email` field before making it non-nullable. Here’s how you can revise the migration script:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add the email column to the students table with nullable=True
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))
    
    # Update existing records to set a default value for email
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = 'default@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL")
    
    # Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )
    
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the default email value (`'default@example.com'`) is appropriate for your application context. You may want to consider a more suitable default or handle it differently based on your application's requirements.
- After making these changes, run the migration again to ensure that it works correctly with existing data.

By addressing this issue, you will ensure that the migration process is robust and does not lead to data integrity problems during the transition to the new schema.

If you implement this change, the code should meet all the requirements and regulations set forth by ChatDev.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration process. The migration script does not handle the case where the `students` table might already contain data when the new `email` column is added. This could lead to potential data integrity issues if the migration is run on an existing database without proper handling of existing records.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**The migration script should ensure that existing records in the `students` table are handled correctly when adding the new `email` column. Specifically, the script should set a default value for the `email` field for existing records before altering the column to be non-nullable.**

### Suggested Revision:
1. Modify the `upgrade()` function in `alembic_migration.py` to ensure that existing records are updated with a default value for the `email` field before making it non-nullable. Here’s how you can revise the migration script:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add the email column to the students table with nullable=True
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))
    
    # Update existing records to set a default value for email
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = 'default@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL")
    
    # Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )
    
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the default email value (`'default@example.com'`) is appropriate for your application context. You may want to consider a more suitable default or handle it differently based on your application's requirements.
- After making these changes, run the migration again to ensure that it works correctly with existing data.

By addressing this issue, you will ensure that the migration process is robust and does not lead to data integrity problems during the transition to the new schema.

If you implement this change, the code should meet all the requirements and regulations set forth by ChatDev."

The migration script does not handle the case where the students table might already contain data when the new email column is added. This could lead to potential data integrity issues if the migration is run on an existing database without proper handling of existing records.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe migration script should ensure that existing records in the students table are handled correctly when adding the new email column. Specifically, the script should set a default value for the email field for existing records before altering the column to be non-nullable.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Modify the upgrade() function in alembic_migration.py to ensure that existing records are updated with a default value for the email field before making it non-nullable. Here’s how you can revise the migration script:\n\npython\ndef upgrade():\n    # Add the email column to the students table with nullable=True\n    op.add_column(\'students\', sa.Column(\'email\', sa.String(), nullable=True))\n    \n    # Update existing records to set a default value for email\n    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = \'default@example.com\' WHERE email IS NULL")\n    \n    # Alter the email column to be non-nullable\n    op.alter_column(\'students\', \'email\', nullable=False)\n    \n    # Create the courses table\n    op.create_table(\n        \'courses\',\n        sa.Column(\'id\', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column(\'name\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column(\'level\', sa.String(), nullable=False),\n    )\n    \n    # Create the association table\n    op.create_table(\n        \'student_courses\',\n        sa.Column(\'student_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'students.id\'), primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column(\'course_id\', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey(\'courses.id\'), primary_key=True),\n    )\n\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Ensure that the default email value (\'default@example.com\') is appropriate for your application context. You may want to consider a more suitable default or handle it differently based on your application\'s requirements.\n- After making these changes, run the migration again to ensure that it works correctly with existing data.\n\nBy addressing this issue, you will ensure that the migration process is robust and does not lead to data integrity problems during the transition to the new schema.\n\nIf you implement this change, the code should meet all the requirements and regulations set forth by ChatDev.'} |

Here is a new customer's task: Add course relationship to Student entity.

Requirements:
- Add a relationship between Student and Course entities
- Student should be able to have courses
- Update the database schema to support this relationship
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script and the creation of the association table for the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `upgrade()` function in the `alembic_migration.py` file does not include a step to ensure that the existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved during the migration. Specifically, if there are existing students and courses, the creation of the `student_courses` association table should be handled carefully to avoid data loss or integrity issues.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Ensure Data Preservation**: Before creating the `student_courses` table, ensure that any existing relationships between students and courses are preserved. If there are existing relationships stored in another format, you should migrate that data into the new association table.

2. **Add Comments for Clarity**: Include comments in the migration script to clarify the purpose of each step, especially regarding data preservation.

Here is an updated version of the `upgrade()` function with comments and a placeholder for data migration:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add the email column to the students table with nullable=True
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))
    # Update existing records to set a default value for email
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = 'default@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL")
    # Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )
    
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )
    
    # TODO: Migrate existing relationships if applicable
    # Example: op.execute("INSERT INTO student_courses (student_id, course_id) SELECT student_id, course_id FROM old_relationships")
```

### Instructions for Fixing:
- Implement the data migration logic if there are existing relationships that need to be preserved.
- Add comments to clarify the purpose of each operation in the migration script.
- Test the migration to ensure that it works correctly without data loss.

By addressing these issues, you will ensure that the software operates correctly and meets the customer's requirements without losing any existing data.

```

### Instructions for Fixing:
- Implement the data migration logic if there are existing relationships that need to be preserved.
- Add comments to clarify the purpose of each operation in the migration script.
- Test the migration to ensure that it works correctly without data loss.

By addressing these issues, you will ensure that the software operates correctly and meets the customer's requirements without losing any existing data.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code, I have identified a critical issue regarding the database migration script and the creation of the association table for the many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`. 

### Highest Priority Comment:
The `upgrade()` function in the `alembic_migration.py` file does not include a step to ensure that the existing data in the `students` and `courses` tables is preserved during the migration. Specifically, if there are existing students and courses, the creation of the `student_courses` association table should be handled carefully to avoid data loss or integrity issues.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Ensure Data Preservation**: Before creating the `student_courses` table, ensure that any existing relationships between students and courses are preserved. If there are existing relationships stored in another format, you should migrate that data into the new association table.

2. **Add Comments for Clarity**: Include comments in the migration script to clarify the purpose of each step, especially regarding data preservation.

Here is an updated version of the `upgrade()` function with comments and a placeholder for data migration:

```python
def upgrade():
    # Add the email column to the students table with nullable=True
    op.add_column('students', sa.Column('email', sa.String(), nullable=True))
    # Update existing records to set a default value for email
    op.execute("UPDATE students SET email = 'default@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL")
    # Alter the email column to be non-nullable
    op.alter_column('students', 'email', nullable=False)
    
    # Create the courses table
    op.create_table(
        'courses',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('level', sa.String(), nullable=False),
    )
    
    # Create the association table
    op.create_table(
        'student_courses',
        sa.Column('student_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('students.id'), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('course_id', sa.Integer(), sa.ForeignKey('courses.id'), primary_key=True),
    )
    
    # TODO: Migrate existing relationships if applicable
    # Example: op.execute("INSERT INTO student_courses (student_id, course_id) SELECT student_id, course_id FROM old_relationships")
```

### Instructions for Fixing:
- Implement the data migration logic if there are existing relationships that need to be preserved.
- Add comments to clarify the purpose of each operation in the migration script.
- Test the migration to ensure that it works correctly without data loss.

By addressing these issues, you will ensure that the software operates correctly and meets the customer's requirements without losing any existing data."

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
